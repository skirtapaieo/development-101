# Van vs React, Angular, Solid, Astro, Qwik

A comparison of Vanjs, React, Angular, Solid, Astro, and Qwik based on

- unopiniated,
- ultralightweight, and
- zero dependency

| Feature          | Vanjs | React | Angular | Solid | Astro | Qwik |
| ---------------- | ----- | ----- | ------- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| Unopiniated      | Yes   | Yes   | No      | Yes   | Yes   | Yes  |
| Ultralightweight | Yes   | No    | No      | Yes   | Yes   | Yes  |
| Zero dependency  | Yes   | No    | No      | Yes   | Yes   | Yes  |

As you can see, Vanjs, React, Solid, Astro, and Qwik are all unopiniated and ultralightweight frameworks. However, only Vanjs and Solid are zero dependency frameworks.

# Detailed comparison

Here is a more detailed comparison of each framework:

- **Vanjs:** Vanjs is a new JavaScript framework that is still under development. It is very lightweight and easy to learn. It is unopiniated, meaning that it does not come with any pre-conceived notions about how your application should be structured. This gives you a lot of flexibility in how you build your application.
- **React:** React is one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks. It is known for its performance and its ability to create complex user interfaces. React is not unopiniated, meaning that it comes with a set of conventions that you are expected to follow. This can make it more difficult to learn, but it also makes it easier to build consistent and maintainable applications.
- **Angular:** Angular is another popular JavaScript framework. It is known for its scalability and its ability to create large, complex applications. Angular is not unopiniated, and it comes with a steeper learning curve than React. However, it is a powerful framework that can be used to build enterprise-grade applications.
- **Solid:** Solid is a new JavaScript framework that is based on React. It is designed to be more unopiniated and easier to learn than React. Solid is still under development, but it has a lot of potential.
- **Astro:** Astro is a new JavaScript framework that is designed to be ultralightweight and easy to use. It is based on React, but it has a simpler syntax and a smaller API. Astro is still under development, but it is gaining popularity among developers who are looking for a lightweight alternative to React.
- **Qwik:** Qwik is a new JavaScript framework that is designed to be ultrafast and easy to learn. It is based on TypeScript, and it uses a functional programming style. Qwik is still under development, but it has a lot of potential for building high-performance web applications.

Ultimately, the best framework for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences. If you are looking for a lightweight and unopiniated framework, then Vanjs, Solid, Astro, or Qwik are good options. If you are looking for a framework that is known for its performance and scalability, then React or Angular may be a better choice.
