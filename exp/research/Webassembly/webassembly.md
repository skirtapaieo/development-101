## Why should I care about WebAssembly?

WebAssembly (often abbreviated as wasm) is designed to be a low-level virtual machine that runs code at near-native speed across different platforms. It enables high-performance execution of code on web browsers, making it crucial for applications that require high speed and efficiency.

## Why WebAssembly was created?

WebAssembly was created to address the performance limitations of JavaScript by providing a binary instruction format that's more efficient to execute. It also aims to be secure and independent of the machine architecture, making it broadly applicable.

## Who created WebAssembly?ls

WebAssembly is a community-driven project that initially had contributions from Mozilla, Microsoft, Google, and Apple.

## How and when was WebAssembly started?

WebAssembly was first announced in June 2015, and the first demonstration came a few months later in a collaboration among major browser vendors.

## Who uses WebAssembly?

Developers building web-based applications that require performance-intensive tasks such as games, 3D rendering, and scientific simulation benefit the most from WebAssembly.

## What are the things that people say WebAssembly needs to improve?

1. **Limited Access to Web APIs**: It doesn't have the same breadth of access to the DOM and other web APIs as JavaScript.
2. **Learning Curve**: A new technology that requires a somewhat different skill set.
3. **Debugging**: Tooling and debugging facilities are still in development.

## What are the main alternatives to WebAssembly?

1. **JavaScript**: Still the most widely supported language for client-side web development.
2. **Native Applications**: For non-web contexts, native machine code.
3. **ASM.js**: A subset of JavaScript aimed at enabling fast numerical computations.

## Overview of the WebAssembly stack

WebAssembly works alongside technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, fitting seamlessly into the existing web ecosystem. Tools commonly used with WebAssembly include:

- **Emscripten**: A toolchain for compiling C and C++ code to WebAssembly.
- **Wasmtime**: A standalone runtime for WebAssembly.
- **Blazor**: A .NET framework that uses WebAssembly.
