# Next.js (Vercel) support of React Server Components

Next.js supports React Server Components (RSCs) by providing a number of features that make it easy to use RSCs to build applications\_

- Automatic server rendering: Next.js automatically renders all pages as RSCs by default. This means that you don't need to do anything special to use RSCs in your Next.js application.
- Support for dynamic routes: Next.js supports dynamic routes, which means that you can use RSCs to render pages that are dynamically generated based on the URL.
- Support for Suspense: Next.js supports Suspense, which allows you to delay the rendering of a component until the data that the component needs is available. This can be useful for improving the performance of RSCs that need to fetch data from the server.
- API routes: Next.js provides API routes, which are routes that are not rendered by React. This can be useful for routing requests to server-side APIs.
