# Edge computing

## Key concepts

- Decentralization - handling some of the computational load locally
- Devices & nodes - like IoT devices, sensor, local servers
- Low latency - processing data near the source
- IT and Internet connection issues

## Use Cases

- Internet of Things
- Augment Reality/Virtual Reality
- Autonomous Vehicle

## Architecture

- Device Layer/Edge layer - physical IoT devices or sensors that collect data - and either processing it locally and/or sending it to the cloud for processing
- Communication layer - the network that connects the IoT-devices to the cloud or other devices - include protocols and technologies as MQTT, CoAP, Wi-Fi, LoRaWan
- Processing Layer/Platform layer - once data reaches the cloud/centralized infrastructure - it is processed, stored and analyzed.
  - This layer also typically included device management and orchestration functions

## Platforms

### AWS IoT

- Core - Provide secure communication between IoT Devices and AWS cloud
- Greengrass - extends AWS to Edge Devices
- IoT Analytics - Analyzes raw IoT data, transformation and loading it for visualization and analysis
