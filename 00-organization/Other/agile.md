# Agile

## Why should I care about Agile?

Agile can help organizations:

- adapt quickly to market changes,
- improve productivity, and
- deliver higher quality products or services.

It emphasizes principles that are universally useful:

- customer satisfaction,
- employee collaboration

## What is the context of Agile?

Originally designed for software development, Agile methodologies have found applicability in various fields like marketing, manufacturing, and even organizational design due to its flexible, iterative approach.

## What is Agile?

Agile is a set of principles and practices for software development that focus on flexibility, collaboration, and customer-centricity. It's not a one-size-fits-all framework but a philosophical approach to solving complex problems.

## Why was Agile conceived?

Agile was conceived as a response to traditional 'Waterfall' project management methodologies that were often too rigid and not adaptable to changes in requirements. The Agile Manifesto, published in 2001, formalized these principles.

## Who came up with Agile?

The Agile Manifesto was created by 17 software developers in 2001. These include well-known figures in Software, like Kent Beck, Martin Fowler, and Jeff Sutherland.

## What are some great Agile examples?

1. **Scrum**: A framework focused on roles, events, and artifacts to help teams become Agile.
2. **Kanban**: A flow-based Agile methodology.
3. **Extreme Programming (XP)**: Focuses on software engineering practices.
4. **SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)**: Designed for large organizations.

## Give a simple code example of Agile?

Agile isn't necessarily a coding methodology, so a code example may not be applicable. However, in an Agile project, you might see regular sprints where new code features are developed, reviewed, and integrated continuously.

## What are the things that people say Agile needs to improve?

1. **Overemphasis on Flexibility**: Sometimes Agile teams lack long-term planning.
2. **Not Always Suitable for Scaling**: Agile practices may need modification when applied to large, complex projects.
3. **Potential for Scope Creep**: Due to its flexible nature.

## What are the main alternatives to Agile?

1. **Waterfall**: A more rigid, stage-gate model of project management.
2. **Six Sigma**: Focused on process improvement and operational excellence.
3. **PRINCE2**: A structured project management method.

## Overview of the Agile stack

Agile doesn't have a "stack" per se, as it's more of a methodology. However, common tools used in Agile settings include Jira for project tracking, Slack for communication, and Jenkins for CI/CD.
