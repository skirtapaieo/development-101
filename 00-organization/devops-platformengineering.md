# DevOps and Platform Engineering

## Introduction

Platform Engineering acts as an enabler and accelerator for the DevOps cycle.

While DevOps focuses on bridging the gap between development and operations through culture and processes, Platform Engineering provides the tools, services, and infrastructure that make it easier to implement those processes.
