# Organization is reflected in your digital space

It is possible to represent the organization digitally by using "channels".

Thinking a little bit about naming conventions is also important - in some cases you have start give recognizable names to task-forces, teams, crews and so on.

A first good step is to put the **teams in a department** in a workspace - and their core members, and to keep the channels as open as possible.

You can conduct a variety of tasks using the tools and also documenting a little bit the progress.

- Support
- Chapter
- Alerts
- Topical
- General

and so on and so on

- Middle management
- Top management
