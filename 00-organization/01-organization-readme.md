# Organization, structure and way of working and technology

Why have a section on organization on Github?

We have a unique gift in the ability to organize ourselves.

Our inherent organizational skills has enabled us to build civilizations, shape the planet, and even reach for the stars.

We do it by structuring, organizing, working together, in big and small iterations, and usually over very long periods of time.

Technology has changed the way we do this and will continue to do so - so experimentation and innovation in organization goes hand in hand with technology.

## Work within organization

See www.transformationkompaniet.com for more.

- DeLaval - about organization of 60 teams, to get a new digital platform in place, and a range of products out to the market.
- Telenor was smaller, around 15 teams, to start a new journey towars digital marketing
- Hemnet - led a few teams as engineering director under the CTO
- Tele2 - organized the transformation at Tele2
- Codeta - interim CTO, in place to launch a product
- SJ - helped them with parts of a transformation
- NetOnNet - helped them clarify their transformation

## A simple model for thinking about organization

I have through the years stitched together a simple model, that is useful in many ways consisting of;

1. structure - what are the building blocks?
2. organization - how do we organize people into groups?
3. way of working - how do people in the structures and organizations work?
4. with a low-level, foundational understanding coordination, iterations and skills required

There are many inspirations, organizationally from Henry Mintzberg, but also from new companies, and own practices.

### 1 Structure - The skeleton of the organization

There are infinite way to describe a structure, lets try something simple:

Top - someone usually leads the company, sometimes founders, sometimes a strong board, sometimes and strong executive team - most big ideas come from here
Middle - when you become a larger organization, you need people to manage people - there are 100s of things needed here in most cases - most administration is done here
Bottom - ok, not the best word, but at the bottom of the pyramid, there are people, that organize around the purpose of the company trying to do things together - very complicated

<br>

### 2 Organization - How people group together

The same people that are part of a structure, are usually also part of collaborative groups:

Club - a group of people with a shared interest, like a discussion group for front-end development
Teams - a group of people, long-running, with a shared and defined mission, and the ability to complete their task autonomously, if possible
Task force - a group of people, with a certain task at hand, limited in time, usually quite complex
Crew - a group of people, that do a certain, usually formalized thing

<br>

### 3 Way of working - How people work together

The different structures and the organization have a certain way of working usually - that is possible to describe in a calender/timeline:

- A top may have daily operational meetings, planning meetings, demos, and so on - with different frequency and members in them
- The middle may have their meetings for their groups - but basically the are leadership meetings or more focused around their area
- The teams also have a certain pulse, with daily meetings, planning for a sprint or longer, retros and actual work meetings

### 4 Merging business (aff√§r) and operations (verksamhet)

It is important that structures, organization focus on understanding the complementarity of business and operations.

You have to think hard about marketing, sales and support - and at the same time continuously address the internal, operational part of the organization.

To achieve things you move together, coordinated, as far as possible, down each row to iterate and test the ideas you have, as fast as possible - as a team, department and a whole company.

# Management

When aligning UX, Product, and Technology, a possible model would focus on the core aspects or stages that are common across most approaches in these fields. Here is a possible general pattern:

| Stage                          | UX                                                                                                  | Product                                                                                                              | Technology                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Understanding/Research**     | Understand the user's needs and context through methods like interviews, surveys, and user testing. | Understand the market, user needs, and business goals to define a product strategy.                                  | Understand the technical requirements, constraints, and possibilities.                                                                    |
| **Ideation/Planning**          | Ideate potential design solutions based on the understanding of the user's needs.                   | Plan and prioritize features based on the product strategy.                                                          | Plan the technical architecture and choose the technologies and methodologies to use.                                                     |
| **Design/Definition**          | Create wireframes, prototypes, and visual designs for the user interface.                           | Define the product requirements and user stories.                                                                    | Design the system architecture and define the technical specifications.                                                                   |
| **Implementation/Development** | Finalize the design details and collaborate with developers to ensure accurate implementation.      | Manage the product backlog and collaborate with the team to implement features.                                      | Develop the software according to the design and technical specifications.                                                                |
| **Testing/Validation**         | Conduct usability testing and gather user feedback to validate the design.                          | Test the product functionality and gather user feedback to validate the product meets user needs and business goals. | Conduct unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing to validate the software functionality and performance. |
| **Iteration/Improvement**      | Iterate on the design based on testing and feedback.                                                | Iterate on the product based on testing, feedback, and changes in the market or business goals.                      | Refactor the code, optimize the system, and implement new features or changes based on feedback and changes in requirements.              |

This is a very simplified model and the actual processes in UX, product, and technology can be much more complex and iterative, and they can vary greatly depending on the specific approaches or methodologies used.

However, this model might be a useful starting point for aligning the different fields and understanding how they can work together in the product development process.
