# Organization, structure and way of working

Humanity's unique gift is the ability to organize ourselves.
Transcending the limits of biology in ways that no other form of life has been able to achieve.
It is this organizational skill that has enabled us to build civilizations, shape the planet, and even reach for the stars.
We do it by structuring, organizing, working together, in big and small iterations, and usually over very long periods of time.

## A simple model

Tying together

1. structure,
2. organization,
3. way of working,
4. with a low-level, foundational understanding coordination, iterations and skills required

### 1 Structure - The skeleton of the organization

There are infinite way to describe a structure, lets try something simple:

Top - someone usually leads the company, sometimes founders, sometimes a strong board, sometimes and strong executive team - most big ideas come from here
Middle - when you become a larger organization, you need people to manage people - there are 100s of things needed here in most cases - most administration is done here
Bottom - ok, not the best word, but at the bottom of the pyramid, there are people, that organize around the purpose of the company trying to do things together - very complicated

### 2 Organization - How people group together

The same people that are part of a structure, are usually also part of collaborative groups:

Club - a group of people with a shared interest, like a discussion group for front-end development
Teams - a group of people, long-running, with a shared and defined mission, and the ability to complete their task autonomously, if possible
Task force - a group of people, with a certain task at hand, limited in time, usually quite complex
Crew - a group of people, that do a certain, usually formalized thing

### 3 Way of working - How people work together

The different structures and the organization have a certain way of working usually - that is possible to describe in a calender/timeline:

- A top may have daily operational meetings, planning meetings, demos, and so on - with different frequency and members in them
- The middle may have their meetings for their groups - but basically the are leadership meetings or more focused around their area
- The teams also have a certain pulse, with daily meetings, planning for a sprint or longer, retros and actual work meetings

### 4 Merging business (aff√§r) and operations (verksamhet)

It is important that structures, organization focus on understanding the complementarity of business and operations.

You have to think hard about marketing, sales and support - and at the same time continuously address the internal, operational part of the organization.

To achieve things you move together, coordinated, as far as possible, down each row to iterate and test the ideas you have, as fast as possible - as a team, department and a whole company.
