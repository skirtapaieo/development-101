# The complicated workplace

Todays organizations are changing from traditional office settings - to the other extreme with remote-first companies - to more of a hybrid model:

Along the dimensions - of being synchronous or not, remote or not, geographically centralized, physical workspace or not, employees only or not - there is a moving and infinite continuum that makes up hybrid - which is the most complex setting which many companies, as a whole, now struggle with.

| Dimension                                  | Traditional Office Setting | Remote-First Company | Hybrid Model | Remote but Time-Zone Centralized | Co-located with Shifts/Flexible Hours |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Sync-Async**                             | Synchronous                | Asynchronous         | Both         | Synchronous                      | Asynchronous                          |
| **Remote-Not Remote**                      | Not Remote                 | Remote               | Both         | Remote                           | Not Remote                            |
| **Geographically Centralized-Distributed** | Centralized                | Distributed          | Both         | Centralized                      | Centralized                           |
| **Workspace**                              | Physical                   | Digital              | Both         | Digital                          | Physical                              |
| **Employees-Consultants**                  | Employees Only             | Employees Only       | Both         | Both                             | Both                                  |

- **Traditional Office Setting**: Generally consists of full-time employees.
- **Remote-First Company**: Also likely to be mostly full-time employees, although freelance or contract work is more common.
- **Hybrid Model**: Could include both employees and consultants, offering greater flexibility in workforce composition.
- **Remote but Time-Zone Centralized**: Could include a mix of employees and consultants, especially if specialized skills are needed.
- **Co-located with Shifts/Flexible Hours**: Could also be a mix, particularly in industries like healthcare, where shift work is common and consultants or temporary staff may be needed.
