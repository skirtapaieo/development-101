# Uber - ride-sharing service etc

# 1 - Background / the why

- Ubers first ride was in 2009
- Have had problems with traditional Taxi regulations
- Does not employ the drivers - been criticized for that
- Problems being addressed - availability, reliabiltiy, transparency, easy to pay, rating system, marketplace flexibility, cost, economic opportunities for car owners, safety features

# 2 - Scope

Uber have a lot of variations in their services: X, XL, Pool, Black, SUV, Comfort, Green, depending on the cars in their fleet. Also Eats, Freight, Air.

The core though passenger-facing and driver-facing services, which we will redesign.

## 3 - Competitors et misc

They have many competitors, like Bolt (Europe), Lyft (US), DiDi (China), Ola (India), Grab (south-east asia), Yandex (Russia).

Voi is a swedish electric scooter company, it has a slightly simpler, but similar service. Tipptapp is also a service similar to this.

## 4 - Riders and Drivers

Uber has 5 million active drivers - and 100 million monthly active riders - and in 2022 Uber completed over 10 billion rides. So each driver make 2 000 rides/year, or 5 per day.

The fleet includes over 40 different vehicle types, ranging from sedans to luxury vehicles.

## 5 - Prior experiences

A few where i have touched this on Spray, Nokia, but not really worked with anything similar - except a side project on boats ...

## 6 - Design

### Use cases

- a user/passenger hails a ride from A to B, it is possible to cancel
- they ask for a certain type of ride (depends on drivers available
- drivers, being tracked and active, address their interest to take the drive
- a match is made with the best match driver
- driver can be tracked,
- the position of the passenger is known for the driver
- a pickup is made
- drive is performed
- target route should be followed? Or else?
- drive is done
- payment is done
- payment is managed
- rating is performed by user

### Interactions, services/API's and description

The central use case of hailing a ride in the Uber system can be broken down into a series of interactions between the rider, driver, and Uber's central systems.

| #   | Interaction                             | Actor        | Service/API                       | Description                                                                           |

This table gives a high-level view of the interactions and associated services/APIs. Each service can further have multiple methods, and the actual implementations might involve more granularity and detail.

### Information model

this is simplified and meant to give a visual depiction of the entities and their attributes. In real-world scenarios, data normalization and other best practices would be applied for efficient database design.

### Rider Table:

| riderID | name     | email             | phone      | paymentMethod        | rating |
| ------- | -------- | ----------------- | ---------- | -------------------- | ------ |
| 1001    | John Doe | johnd@example.com | 1234567890 | Credit Card \*\*\*\* | 4.7    |

### Driver Table:

| driverID | name        | email             | phone      | carDetails             | rating |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ---------------------- | ------ |
| 5001     | Alice Smith | alice@example.com | 9876543210 | Toyota Camry '20 - XYZ | 4.9    |

### Ride Table:

| rideID | riderID | driverID | startLocation | endLocation | startTime      | endTime         | fare | route     |
| ------ | ------- | -------- | ------------- | ----------- | -------------- | --------------- | ---- | --------- |
| 8001   | 1001    | 5001     | Point A       | Point B     | 2023-08-09 9AM | 2023-08-09 10AM | $15  | A > X > B |

### Payment Table:

| paymentID | riderID | rideID | amount | paymentMethod        | timestamp       |
| --------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | -------------------- | --------------- |
| 9001      | 1001    | 8001   | $15    | Credit Card \*\*\*\* | 2023-08-09 10AM |

### Rating Table:

| ratingID | riderID | driverID | rideID | score | feedback                    |
| -------- | ------- | -------- | ------ | ----- | --------------------------- |
| 7001     | 1001    | -        | 8001   | 5     | Great and smooth drive!     |
| 7002     | -       | 5001     | 8001   | 4     | Rider was polite and quiet. |

For simplification, the '-' denotes missing or non-applicable data in the tables. In an actual database, you'd want to use NULL or another appropriate representation.

### The tricky parts of the service

### Rider and Driver tracking

These are tightly related and they deal with real-time location tracking and sharing.

#### Proximity Matching

##### Roads are networks

Finding the nearest driver is not a simple make a line from A to B.

- The roads are networks- with nodes, edges, properties/weights and so on
- Algorithms such as Dijkstras algorithm or A\* can help finding shortest path
- Reality adds complexity - overpasses/underpasses, tunnels, closed for maintenance, temporarily blocked due to incidents, traffic conditions
- Dynamic updates - mapping system try to incorporate real-time data to match models with reality

Finding the nearest driver assumes a good underlying mapping system, for routing, estimating time to arrival between A and B.

##### Tools available

There are tools available such as

- OpenStreetMap (OSM) and OSRM (OpenStreetMap Routing Machine) that is an open source collaborative project
- Graphhopper - uses OSM to calculate routes
- MAP APIs - major map providers like Google Maps, Bing and Mapbox provide API f√∂r distance and routing calculations and can be used for proximity matching

##### For ride hailing (or other types of matching)

- Use above tools as a start
- Update drivers locations - and recalculate ETA
- On ride requests - find potential matches, sort by driver rating, vehicle type, etc
- Do on the fly computation for matching, which might be more resous intensive, but will use most up-to-date data
- Doing a straightline calculation followed by other more intricated calculations if needed

### Ride Matching Service

#### Pricing, fare adjustments and payments

Uber's fare system is built around dynamic pricing, and there can be several reasons for fare adjustments. While I don't have an exact number for how many fare adjustments Uber processes (as this would depend on numerous factors and can vary across regions and time), the reasons for fare adjustments generally fall into several categories:

1. **Technical Issues**: Sometimes, there might be glitches or errors in the app that cause discrepancies in the fare. This could be due to GPS inaccuracies, server issues, or other technical glitches.

2. **Rider Complaints**: If a rider feels they were charged unfairly, perhaps due to a longer route taken by the driver or other reasons, they can file a complaint. If Uber finds the claim valid, they might adjust the fare.

3. **Driver Reports**: Similar to riders, drivers can also report issues. For instance, if a rider made a stop during the trip that was not accounted for in the fare, the driver can report it, leading to a fare adjustment.

4. **Promotions & Refunds**: Sometimes, Uber provides promotions, discounts, or special offers. If a rider was eligible for a promotion but it wasn't applied during billing, a fare adjustment might be done retroactively.

5. **Surge Pricing Adjustment**: Uber's dynamic pricing model, often referred to as "surge pricing", adjusts fares based on the demand for rides in a specific area. If there's an issue or miscalculation related to surge pricing, adjustments might be needed.

6. **Safety Issues**: If there was a safety incident or a severe violation of Uber's community guidelines during a ride, it could lead to a fare being adjusted or even fully refunded.

7. **External Factors**: Events outside of Uber's control, like road closures, extreme weather conditions, or significant public events, can sometimes cause unexpected detours or delays. If these result in a significantly higher fare, adjustments might be considered.

8. **Incomplete Trips**: If a trip is cut short for any reason ‚Äì maybe the rider chose to get off earlier than the destination or there was an issue with the vehicle ‚Äì a fare adjustment might be needed.

Riders and drivers can report fare discrepancies through the app, and Uber typically reviews these reports to determine if an adjustment is warranted. Given the millions of rides Uber processes, it's reasonable to assume that a small percentage of them might need fare adjustments.
