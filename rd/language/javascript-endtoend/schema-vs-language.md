# Schema interpreter vs language

These are broad strokes, and the specifics can vary depending on the browser or the schema interpreter in use.

When comparing the steps involved in a browser interpreting JavaScript and a schema interpreter understanding a schema-based data structure, the processes share some similarities but also have fundamental differences. Below is a comparison table that summarizes the key steps in both scenarios:

```markdown
| Step Number | Browser Interpreting JavaScript | Schema Interpreter             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1           | Fetch Script from Server        | Fetch Schema                   |
| 2           | Tokenization                    | Schema Parsing                 |
| 3           | Parsing (AST Creation)          | Data Type Checking             |
| 4           | Compilation (Bytecode/JIT)      | (Optional) Data Transformation |
| 5           | Execution                       | Validation                     |
| 6           | DOM Manipulation                | (Optional) Report Generation   |
```

## Browser Interpreting JavaScript

1. **Fetch Script**: The browser fetches the JavaScript file from the server.
2. **Tokenization**: The script undergoes lexical analysis to break it down into tokens.
3. **Parsing**: An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is generated.
4. **Compilation**: The AST might be compiled into bytecode, or Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled.
5. **Execution**: The script is executed, affecting the browser environment.
6. **DOM Manipulation**: Optionally, the JavaScript may interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) to change the webpage.

## Schema Interpreter

1. **Fetch Schema**: The interpreter reads the schema, which may be hard-coded, read from a file, or fetched from a server.
2. **Schema Parsing**: The schema is often in JSON or XML format and must be parsed into an object or data structure.
3. **Data Type Checking**: The interpreter checks if the data types in the provided data match the schema.
4. **Data Transformation**: Optionally, the interpreter may transform the data to conform to the schema.
5. **Validation**: The data is validated against the schema, and any deviations are flagged.
6. **Report Generation**: Optionally, a report can be generated, detailing the validation results.

## Similarities

- Both involve some form of **parsing**.
- Both may involve **fetching data** from external sources.
- Both result in **validation or execution** of some kind of instructions (either JavaScript commands or schema rules).

## Differences

- The browser's JavaScript interpretation involves **compilation and execution steps**, which are not typically part of schema interpretation.
- **DOM manipulation** is unique to the browser context.
- Schema interpreters often focus on **validation and data transformation**, which are not primary concerns for JavaScript execution in a browser.
- Schema interpreters may produce a **validation report**, whereas browsers execute effects (like DOM changes or API calls).
