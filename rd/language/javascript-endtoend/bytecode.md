You can't directly view the bytecode for JavaScript in a typical browser environment because the JavaScript engines like V8 (used in Chrome), SpiderMonkey (used in Firefox), or JavaScriptCore (used in Safari) don't expose this level of detail by default.

However, if you're determined to see the bytecode, you have a couple of options:

### Using V8's `d8` Debugger:

The standalone shell for V8, known as `d8`, can be built with flags that enable bytecode inspection. If you are interested in this, you will have to clone the V8 code, build it, and then run your JavaScript file with a specific flag to print the bytecode.

1. Clone V8 and build `d8`.
2. Run your JavaScript code using `d8` with special flags like `--print-bytecode`.

For example, for a JavaScript file named `example.js`, you would run:

```bash
./d8 --print-bytecode example.js
```

This will print out the bytecode generated by the V8 engine for the code in `example.js`.

### Using SpiderMonkey's `js` Shell:

1. Download and compile SpiderMonkey.
2. Use the `-D` flag to disassemble bytecode.

```bash
./js -D example.js
```

### Using Third-Party Tools:

While not displaying actual bytecode, some tools like AST Explorer can help you visualize the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generated by the code. This won't be the bytecode but it'll give you some idea about how the code will be executed.

### Other Languages:

If you are interested in learning about bytecode in a more user-friendly environment, you may consider starting with a language that allows easy bytecode inspection like Python. The `dis` module in Python standard library can disassemble Python code into bytecode, which you can view.

```python
import dis

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

dis.dis(add)
```

All these approaches require a considerable amount of setup and are not trivial undertakings. However, they can provide you with valuable insights into the inner workings of JavaScript engines.
