A list of the sections where the criticism was either partially addressed or not addressed, along with explanations for each.

To fully grasp these issues and work around them, it's often necessary to go beyond typical overviews of Go and delve into the documentation, community guidelines, and third-party libraries.

### Partially Explained

1. **Foundations in Golang (Criticism 1)**
   - **Concept**: Nil pointers
   - **How Go can go wrong**: Dereferencing a nil pointer will cause a runtime panic.
   - **How to avoid it**: Always check for nil before dereferencing pointers.

2. **Object-oriented programming (Criticism 4, 5)**
   - **Concept**: OOP and implicit interface implementation
   - **How Go can go wrong**: The lack of traditional OOP features can be limiting. Implicit interface implementation can lead to mistakes.
   - **How to avoid it**: Understand the Go way of doing OOP. Read the documentation carefully to know which interfaces are being implemented.

3. **Data Types (Criticism 8, 10, 19)**
   - **Concept**: Struct limitations, type issues with pointers/non-pointers, and poor generics
   - **How Go can go wrong**: Cannot easily reuse or omit struct keys. Issues with zero values and pointers. Limited generic functionality.
   - **How to avoid it**: Explicitly handle these limitations in code, possibly using helper functions or third-party libraries.

4. **Practicalities in Golang (Criticism 9, 15, 25)**
   - **Concept**: JSON handling, JSON validation, and the magic `init` method
   - **How Go can go wrong**: JSON mapping logic in string tags leads to errors. The `init` method runs automatically, leading to unexpected behavior.
   - **How to avoid it**: Be cautious with struct tags for JSON and always read up on libraries you use for validation. Understand the lifecycle of a Go program, including `init` methods.

5. **Basic Golang (Criticism 24)**
   - **Concept**: Variable shadowing
   - **How Go can go wrong**: Shadowing global functions can cause unexpected behavior.
   - **How to avoid it**: Be mindful of variable names and their scope.

6. **Testing (Criticism 32)**
   - **Concept**: Mocking for tests
   - **How Go can go wrong**: The lack of certain language features makes mocking cumbersome.
   - **How to avoid it**: Use specialized testing and mocking libraries, or design code to be more easily testable.

### Not Explained

1. **Data Types (Criticism 3, 7, 13, 14, 23)**
   - Union/sum types, dynamic struct key access, enums, and multiple JSON keys are not native features in Go. Therefore, they are generally not explained in typical overviews.

2. **Functions (Criticism 11, 20)**
   - Function overloading and default/optional function arguments are not supported in Go, so these are not covered.

3. **Error Handling (Criticism 21, 22)**
   - Golang does not use stack traces or try/catch blocks for error handling. Special strategies are required to achieve similar functionalities.

4. **Advanced Topics in Golang (Criticism 28, 29)**
   - High-level utility methods like map/filter and complex async operations are not natively supported in Go.

5. **Functional Programming (Criticism 30, 31)**
   - Higher-order functional programming patterns and immutable coding styles are not Go's strengths.
