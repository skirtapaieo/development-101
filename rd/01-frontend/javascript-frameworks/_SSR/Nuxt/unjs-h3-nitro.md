- **UnJS** is a collection of JavaScript tools that are designed to make it easier to build web applications. It includes tools for routing, state management, and more.
- **h3** is a minimal HTTP framework that is built for high performance and portability. It can be used in a variety of environments, including serverless, workers, and Node.js.
- **Nitro** is a universal backend that is powered by h3. It provides a number of features that make it easy to build and deploy web applications, such as file-based routing, asset handling, and storage abstraction.

Here is a brief overview of each project:

- **UnJS**
  - Routing: UnJS includes a routing system that makes it easy to define and manage the routes in your application.
  - State management: UnJS includes a state management system that makes it easy to store and manage data in your application.
  - Utilities: UnJS includes a number of utilities that make it easier to build web applications, such as a logger, a validator, and a form builder.
- **h3**
  - Performance: h3 is designed to be very performant. It is small and lightweight, and it uses native promises for asynchronous operations.
  - Portability: h3 can be used in a variety of environments, including serverless, workers, and Node.js.
  - Extensibility: h3 is extensible. It provides a number of hooks that can be used to customize its behavior.
- **Nitro**
  - File-based routing: Nitro supports file-based routing, which makes it easy to define and manage the routes in your application.

  - Storage abstraction: Nitro provides a storage abstraction that makes it easy to access data from a variety of storage backends, such as Firebase and AWS S3.

# Nuxt

Nuxt is supported by UnJS, h3, and Nitro. Nuxt 3 is powered by Nitro, which internally uses h3. This means that Nuxt 3 inherits all of the benefits of h3, such as its performance, portability, and extensibility.

In addition, Nuxt also uses UnJS for routing and state management. This makes it easy to build and maintain Nuxt applications.

Overall, Nuxt is a great choice for building web applications. It is backed by a strong community and it is supported by a number of open-source projects, such as UnJS, h3, and Nitro.

Here are some of the benefits of using Nuxt with UnJS, h3, and Nitro:

- **Performance:** Nuxt is built on top of Vue, which is a very performant framework. By using h3 and Nitro, Nuxt can be made even more performant.
- **Portability:** Nuxt can be used in a variety of environments, including serverless, workers, and Node.js. This is because h3 is a portable framework that can be used in any environment that supports HTTP requests.
- **Extensibility:** Nuxt is extensible. It can be customized to meet the needs of any project. This is because UnJS, h3, and Nitro are all extensible frameworks.
- **Community:** Nuxt has a large and active community. This means that there are a lot of resources available to help you learn and use Nuxt.
