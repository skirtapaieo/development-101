## Why should I care about Unpoly?

Unpoly is designed for developers who want to create dynamic and responsive web applications without relying on heavier front-end frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue. It is particularly useful for progressively enhancing server-rendered apps, making them more interactive and quicker to navigate. It's an excellent choice if you're looking to modernize a legacy application or want a lighter solution for a new project.

## Who created Unpoly?

Unpoly was created by the team at [Trivial Technology](https://trivial.de/), a software development company.

## Why the name Unpoly?

The name "Unpoly" seems to suggest an "uncomplicated" or "unobtrusive" approach to web development. It stands in contrast to the more "polymorphic" and complex client-side frameworks out there.

## Why Unpoly was created?

Unpoly was created to bridge the gap between static server-rendered applications and dynamic single-page applications (SPAs). It aims to offer the best of both worlds by providing a mechanism for partial page updates, quicker navigation, and seamless UI updates without requiring a complete rewrite or heavy client-side code.

## How and when was Unpoly started?

Unpoly was started to help web developers bring dynamic features to server-rendered web applications without abandoning the server's rendering capabilities. While exact timelines are not publicly documented, the library has been in active development for several years.

## Who uses Unpoly?

Unpoly is mainly used by web developers working on projects where server-rendering is preferred or mandatory. This includes modernizing legacy projects and creating new, lightweight web applications.

## What are the things that people say Unpoly needs to improve?

1. **Community and Ecosystem**: Being a less popular framework, it has fewer third-party libraries and community contributions compared to mainstream frameworks.
2. **Documentation**: While adequate, the documentation could be more extensive, especially for complex use-cases.

## What are the main alternatives to Unpoly?

1. **Turbolinks**: Similar in scope, focusing on enhancing server-rendered applications.
2. **React, Angular, Vue**: These are not direct alternatives but are the go-to frameworks for client-side rendered applications.
3. **Alpine.js**: A minimal framework for composing JavaScript behavior in your HTML, another lighter alternative to Vue or React.

## Overview of the Unpoly stack

- **JavaScript**: Core library written in JavaScript.
- **Server-Side**: Compatible with any server-side language/framework as it enhances the server-rendered HTML.
- **CSS**: Customizable and comes with its CSS selectors to define behavior.
- **HTML**: Works by annotating HTML elements with special attributes to enable dynamic behaviors.
