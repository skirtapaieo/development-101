**Features:**

All of the providers listed above support a wide range of languages and frameworks. However, AWS Lambda@Edge has the most limited feature set, supporting only a subset of Lambda features, such as Node.js, Python, and Java.

Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute@Edge, Vercel Edge Functions, Netlify Edge Functions, Akamai EdgeWorkers, StackPath Edge, Twilio Functions, and Google Cloud Functions (Edge) all support a wider range of features, including support for additional languages, frameworks, and features such as machine learning and database access.

**Which one should you choose?**

The best choice for you will depend on your specific needs and requirements. If you need low latency and high performance, then any of the edge serverless providers listed above would be a good option.

If you need a more general-purpose serverless solution, then you may want to consider a cloud serverless provider such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.

If you are on a tight budget, then Cloudflare Workers is the most affordable edge serverless provider.

I recommend that you evaluate your needs and requirements carefully before choosing an edge serverless provider. You may also want to consider using a combination of edge serverless and cloud serverless to optimize your costs and performance.
