## Why should I care about SST?

SST (Serverless Stack Toolkit) is a framework built on top of AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) designed to make it easier to build serverless applications. SST comes with features like live Lambda development, infrastructure-as-code, and built-in best practices, making it a powerful tool for building scalable, modern applications on AWS.

## Who created SST?

SST was created by Jay V and Frank Wang, who are also the authors of the popular Serverless Stack Guide, a free comprehensive resource for learning serverless.

## Why the name SST?

SST stands for Serverless Stack Toolkit. The name clearly describes its focus on serverless architecture and its utility as a toolkit for developers.

## Why SST was created?

SST was created to simplify the development and deployment of serverless applications on AWS. It aims to address some of the complexities associated with managing serverless resources by providing an easier development experience.

## How and when was SST started?

SST started as an extension of the popular Serverless Stack Guide. It was officially launched in 2020 to help streamline serverless application development.

## Who uses SST?

SST is used by developers who want to build serverless applications on AWS without dealing with the complexities of manually managing each service. It's particularly useful for startups and small to medium enterprises that want to build scalable applications quickly.

## What are the things that people say SST needs to improve?

- **Learning Curve**: While SST aims to simplify serverless development, it still requires a decent understanding of AWS services.
- **Community**: Being relatively new, the community around SST is still growing.
- **Documentation**: Although extensive, some users have mentioned that the documentation could be improved for specific use-cases.

## What are the main alternatives to SST?

The main alternatives to SST include the Serverless Framework, AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model), and directly using AWS CDK.

## Overview of the SST stack

SST is built on top of AWS CDK and offers additional features like:
- **Live Lambda Development**: Allows you to work on your Lambda functions locally but invoke them in a live AWS environment.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: You can define all your infrastructure in code, making it easier to manage and version-control.
- **Built-in Best Practices**: Comes with built-in best practices for serverless architecture.

SST could be a relevant technology if you're planning to build your "Tribe" organizational structure as a serverless application on AWS. It would simplify a lot of the infrastructure management, allowing you to focus more on your application's logic.
