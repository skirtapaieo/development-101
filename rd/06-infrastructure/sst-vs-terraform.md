# SST (Serverless Stack Toolkit) vs. Terraform

## Why should I care about SST and Terraform?

Both SST and Terraform are tools for managing infrastructure as code, but they serve different needs and ecosystems. SST focuses on serverless applications and is tailored for AWS, while Terraform is a more general infrastructure as code tool that supports multiple cloud providers.

## Who created SST and Terraform?

- SST was created by Jay V and Frank Wang as part of the Serverless Stack.
- Terraform was created by HashiCorp, a company known for cloud infrastructure automation tools.

## Why the names SST and Terraform?

- SST stands for Serverless Stack Toolkit, highlighting its serverless focus.
- Terraform implies shaping or forming your cloud environment, much like terraforming a planet would involve shaping its environment.

## Why were SST and Terraform created?

- SST was created to simplify the development and deployment of serverless applications specifically on AWS.
- Terraform was designed to provide a unified way to manage and provision cloud infrastructure across multiple providers.

## How and when were SST and Terraform started?

- SST was officially launched in 2020 as an extension of the Serverless Stack Guide.
- Terraform was first released in 2014 and has since become one of the leading infrastructure as code tools.

## Who uses SST and Terraform?

- SST is mainly used by developers building serverless applications on AWS.
- Terraform is widely used by DevOps engineers and cloud architects working with various cloud providers.

## What are the things that people say SST and Terraform need to improve?

- **SST**: Learning curve, growing community, documentation for specific use-cases.
- **Terraform**: Complexity, state management, error messages can be vague.

## What are the main alternatives?

- **SST**: Alternatives include AWS SAM, Serverless Framework, and AWS CDK.
- **Terraform**: Alternatives include AWS CloudFormation, Azure ARM templates, and Google Cloud Deployment Manager.

| Extensibility          | Built on AWS CDK, can use AWS CDK components     | Provider plugins for multiple services                |
| Live Debugging         | Yes (Live Lambda Development)                    | No                                                   |
| Ecosystem Integration  | Closely integrated with AWS services             | Can integrate with various providers and services    |

While both SST and Terraform allow you to manage infrastructure as code, they are tailored for different scenarios. SST is more focused on serverless applications and is AWS-specific. Terraform, on the other hand, offers a more general-purpose, provider-agnostic approach. Your choice between the two would depend on your specific project requirements, cloud provider, and the type of infrastructure you are managing.
