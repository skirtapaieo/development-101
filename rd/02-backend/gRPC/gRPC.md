# gRPC

## Why should I care about gRPC?

gRPC is a high-performance, open-source, and universal RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework that can make your microservices architecture more efficient and robust. It offers features like automatic code generation, bi-directional streaming, and robust authentication, making it a great choice for building distributed systems.

## What is the context of gRPC?

In modern software development, particularly in a microservices architecture, services often need to communicate with each other. gRPC serves as the communication layer that lets different services interact efficiently, whether they're running on the same server or are distributed across the globe.

## What is gRPC?

gRPC is a protocol and library for efficient, robust, and scalable service-to-service communication. It is based on Google's Protocol Buffers (ProtoBuf) as the Interface Description Language (IDL) and HTTP/2 for the transport layer, allowing for robust communication between services.

## Why was gRPC conceived?

gRPC was conceived to meet the need for a framework that could offer high performance, support multiple programming languages, and be extensible, all while being effective for both server-to-server and server-to-client communication.

## Who came up with gRPC?

gRPC was developed by Google as a successor to earlier technologies like CORBA and Java RMI, and it was open-sourced in 2015.

## What are some great gRPC examples?

- Google itself uses gRPC internally for many of its microservices.
- Netflix, Cisco, and Juniper for networking services.
- CoreOS for its distributed systems.

## Give a simple code example of gRPC?

Here's a very simplified gRPC server and client example in Python.

**Server**

```python
from concurrent import futures
import grpc
import your_grpc_definitions  # Assuming you have your grpc definitions here

class YourService(your_grpc_definitions.YourServiceServicer):
    def YourMethod(self, request, context):
        return your_grpc_definitions.YourResponse(message='Hello, {}'.format(request.name))

server = grpc.server(futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10))
your_grpc_definitions.add_YourServiceServicer_to_server(YourService(), server)
server.add_insecure_port('[::]:50051')
server.start()
```

**Client**

```python
import grpc
import your_grpc_definitions

channel = grpc.insecure_channel('localhost:50051')
stub = your_grpc_definitions.YourServiceStub(channel)
response = stub.YourMethod(your_grpc_definitions.YourRequest(name='you'))
print("Greeter client received: " + response.message)
```

## What are the things that people say gRPC needs to improve?

- Easier debugging and tracing.
- Better documentation.
- Support for more programming languages.

## What are the main alternatives to gRPC?

- RESTful APIs over HTTP/1.1
- GraphQL
- Thrift
- WebSockets

## Overview of the gRPC stack

- **Transport Layer**: HTTP/2
- **Interface Definition Language**: Protocol Buffers
- **Code Generation**: Language-specific plugins
- **Runtime**: Provides features like load balancing, retries, etc.
