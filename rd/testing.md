| Type of Testing   | Tool      | Brief Explanation |
|-------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| Unit Testing      | Jest      | JavaScript testing framework focused on simplicity, often used for testing React applications. |
| Unit Testing      | Jasmine   | Behavior-driven JavaScript testing framework that does not rely on any JavaScript frameworks or a DOM. |
| Integration Testing | Jest    | Provides features like mocking and spying to test the interactions between units of code. |
| Integration Testing | Mocha    | Feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. |
| End-to-End Testing  | Selenium | Automates web browsers, allowing you to write scripts in various languages and run tests across multiple OS and browsers. |
| End-to-End Testing  | Cypress  | Modern web testing framework designed to handle the complexities of modern web apps, running natively in the browser. |
| API Testing        | Frisby    | REST API testing framework built on Jest, focuses on making API endpoint testing fast and easy. |
| API Testing        | Postman   | Collaboration platform for API development, also used for API testing through its user-friendly interface. |
| UI Testing         | Selenium  | Same as above, widely used for automating UI tests. |
| UI Testing         | Puppeteer | Node library that provides a high-level API to control Chrome over the DevTools Protocol, good for headless browsing and scraping. |
