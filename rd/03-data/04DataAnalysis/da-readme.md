# Data Analysis

## Question

We have a step in the data pipeline called Data Analysis, "after" data storage/processing/transformation.

- what is the distinction between them?
- the area has technologies like SQL, Pandas, Numpy, R, Hive, Pig, Databricks Scikit-learn

## Answer

- Data analysis is a crucial step in the data pipeline
- distinct from data storage, processing, and transformation.

Let's break down each step and then delve into the distinction:

1. **Data Storage**: As the name implies, it's about where you keep the data. Databases (like SQL databases, NoSQL databases), data warehouses (like BigQuery or Snowflake), and data lakes are typical storage solutions.

2. **Data Processing/Transformation**: This step involves cleaning, transforming, and structuring raw data into a format suitable for analysis.

It could mean cleaning out missing or incorrect values, transforming data types, or reshaping datasets. Tools and platforms like Spark, Beam, and Airflow are often utilized for these tasks.

3. **Data Analysis**: After processing and storing the data, we now want to derive insights from it.

Data analysis is about

- understanding the data,
- extracting patterns,
- making predictions,
- and informing decision-making.

It's often a combination of descriptive statistics, visualizations, and machine learning models. This is where SQL, Pandas, Numpy, R, Hive, Pig, Databricks, and Scikit-learn come into play.

Now, diving into the distinction:

- **Scope**:

  - **Processing/Transformation**: Aimed at getting the data "ready" for analysis. You're ensuring that the data is clean, reliable, and in the right format/structure.
  - **Analysis**: It's about extracting value and insights from the prepared data. What are the patterns? What does the data suggest? How can this data inform decisions?

- **Tools & Technologies**:

  - **Processing/Transformation**: Tools here are designed for large-scale data manipulation. Spark, for instance, can handle large-scale data transformation across clusters.
  - **Analysis**: Tools in this phase are more about querying, visualization, and modeling. For instance:
    - **SQL**: Used to query relational databases.
    - **Pandas & Numpy**: Python libraries for data manipulation and mathematical operations.
    - **R**: A language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
    - **Hive & Pig**: Big data tools for querying and processing.
    - **Databricks**: A platform based on Spark, which can handle both processing and advanced analytics.
    - **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library in Python.

- **End Goal**:
  - **Processing/Transformation**: A cleaned and structured dataset ready for analysis.
  - **Analysis**: Insights, visualizations, models, and recommendations.

While there's a clear distinction between processing and analysis, in practical scenarios, especially with tools like Databricks or Pandas, the line might blur a bit. A data analyst or scientist might do some last-minute transformations during the analysis phase, or someone working on data transformation might conduct preliminary analysis to understand the data better. However, the primary objectives of each phase remain distinct.
