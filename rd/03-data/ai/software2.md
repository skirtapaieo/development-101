## Why should I care about Software 2.0?

Software 2.0 is increasingly dominating applications where traditional software struggles, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles. Understanding it will help you stay at the forefront of technological developments.

## What is the context of Software 2.0?

It builds upon the traditional programming paradigm (Software 1.0), focusing on data-driven approaches where machine learning models are "trained" rather than "programmed".

## What is Software 2.0?

Software 2.0 is a term that refers to the use of machine learning models to perform tasks traditionally done by human-written code.

## Why was Software 2.0 conceived?

To overcome the limitations of explicitly programmed solutions for complex tasks and to harness the power of data.

## Who came up with Software 2.0?

The term was popularized by Andrej Karpathy, Director of AI at Tesla.

## What are some great Software 2.0 examples?

1. Google's search algorithms
2. Tesla's autopilot system
3. Personalized recommendation systems like those used by Netflix

## Give a simple code example of Software 2.0?

```python
# A simple example using scikit-learn for classification
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

data = load_iris()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.data, data.target)
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
accuracy = clf.score(X_test, y_test)
```

## What are the things that people say Software 2.0 needs to improve?

1. Explainability
2. Resource Efficiency
3. Robustness

## What are the main alternatives to Software 2.0?

Traditional rule-based programming and expert systems.

## Overview of the Software 2.0 stack

1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Training
4. Model Deployment
