It is good to differentiate the recent LLM models, with chatbots and virtual assistants.

| Aspect/Feature       | Conversational AI Models                                     | Chatbot                                              | Virtual Assistant                                               |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Base Technology**  | Deep learning (Transformer architecture)                     | Varies (rule-based, machine learning, NLP)           | Advanced NLP, machine learning, AI                              |
| **Primary Function** | Conversational interactions                                  | Specific tasks or predefined queries                 | Wide range of tasks (reminders, search, device control)         |
| **Training**         | Trained on vast amounts of text, fine-tuned for conversation | Often trained for specific domains or tasks          | Trained for general tasks, often with user personalization      |
| **Interactivity**    | Designed for extended, natural-sounding conversations        | Typically short, transactional interactions          | Extended, context-aware interactions                            |
| **Integration**      | Platforms like OpenAI's API                                  | Websites, messaging apps, social media platforms     | Integrated into operating systems (smartphones, smart speakers) |
| **Customization**    | Limited to model's training                                  | Can be custom-built for specific tasks or industries | Often allows user personalization and third-party integrations  |
| **Complexity**       | Advanced due to deep learning techniques                     | Can range from simple to advanced                    | Advanced, with integration of various services and hardware     |
| **Limitations**      | Can produce incorrect or nonsensical answers                 | Limited to predefined rules or trained data          | Limited by OS integrations and user permissions                 |
