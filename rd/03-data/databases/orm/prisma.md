## Why should I care about Prisma?

Prisma is a next-generation ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) that aims to make it easier for developers to work with databases. It provides a robust type-safe query builder based on your database schema, enabling you to write secure and scalable code. Prisma supports various databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and SQL Server, among others.

## Who created Prisma?

Prisma was created by a company also named Prisma, which is primarily focused on improving database workflows for developers.

## Why the name Prisma?

The name "Prisma" doesn't have an official explanation regarding its origin, but it might be seen as a lens through which you view and interact with your database, simplifying complex tasks into manageable ones.

## Why Prisma was created?

Prisma was created to solve many of the issues developers face with traditional ORMs, such as lack of type safety, cumbersome query building, and database migration difficulties. It aims to offer a more straightforward, robust, and flexible way to interact with databases.

## How and when was Prisma started?

Prisma was initially released in 2017 as Graphcool, a backend development framework for GraphQL. It pivoted and rebranded as Prisma in 2018, shifting its focus towards database tooling. The Prisma Client and Prisma Migrate are some of its key components.

## Who uses Prisma?

Prisma is used by developers of all levels and organizations of all sizes. It's popular among both front-end and back-end developers who need a simplified, robust, and efficient way to interact with databases.

## What are the things that people say Prisma needs to improve?

Some common feedback includes:
- Learning curve: Prisma has many features, and it might take some time to get accustomed to them.
- Limited database support: While Prisma supports many popular databases, the list is not exhaustive.
- Advanced query capabilities: Although Prisma offers a robust query API, some users feel it lacks certain advanced querying features found in native SQL.

## What are the main alternatives to Prisma?

The main alternatives to Prisma include traditional ORMs like Sequelize, TypeORM, and Hibernate, as well as query builders like Knex.js.

## Overview of the Prisma stack

Prisma is primarily composed of:
1. **Prisma Client**: An auto-generated query builder used in your application code.
2. **Prisma Migrate**: A declarative data modeling and migration tool.
3. **Prisma Studio**: A modern database GUI to view and edit your data.

Prisma can be a good fit for your "Tribe" project, especially if you're considering using Retool for the back-end tasks. It could handle the data layer, making it easier to perform CRUD operations and manage your organizational structure.
