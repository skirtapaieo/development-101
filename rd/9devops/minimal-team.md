# Minimalistic team, with good practices

You can emulate a more protected workflow even as a single developer to get used to the best practices.

This is especially useful as you anticipate growing the team. Here's how you can set it up:

- **Best Practices**: Get accustomed to a workflow that promotes best practices in code development.
- **Easier Onboarding**: When you grow your team, the onboarding process will be smoother as the robust workflow is already in place.
- **Quality Assurance**: The process ensures higher code quality and a more maintainable codebase.

By practicing these steps, you'll get into the habit of rigorous version control practices that will serve you well as your team grows.
### Steps

1. **Branch Strategy**: Always create a new branch for each new feature or bugfix. No direct commits to `main` or `master`.

2. **Pull Requests**: Merge these feature or bugfix branches back into the `main` or `master` branch only through pull requests.

3. **Code Reviews**: Review your own pull requests or ask a colleague or friend to review them. GitHub allows you to review your own pull requests, although the exercise will be more effective with a second pair of eyes.

4. **Status Checks**: Integrate a CI/CD tool like GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or Jenkins to run automated tests. You can set this up to be a requirement before merges are allowed.

5. **Protected Branches**: Set up the `main` or `master` branch as a protected branch. This will enforce the rules you've set up.

6. **Documentation**: Always update the documentation as part of your pull request if your changes affect how users or developers interact with the project.

7. **Merges**: Once the pull request is reviewed and all checks pass, merge it into the main codebase. Delete the feature branch afterward to keep things tidy.

### Simple Workflow Table
Here's a simple table to break down these steps:

```markdown
| Step            | Description                                                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Branch Strategy | Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix.                        |
| Pull Requests   | Use pull requests to merge new changes.                                |
| Code Reviews    | Review code either yourself or have it reviewed by someone else.       |
| Status Checks   | Integrate automated testing for pull requests.                         |
| Protected Branch| Protect the `main` or `master` branch to enforce these rules.          |
| Documentation   | Update docs within the pull request if necessary.                       |
| Merges          | Merge pull requests only after reviews and checks, then delete branch. |
