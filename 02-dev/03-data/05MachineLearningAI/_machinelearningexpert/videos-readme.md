| Topic                      | Essential Principles                                                                              | Key Features                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Naive Bayes**            | Based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence between features.                     | - Probabilistic classification. <br> - Works well with high-dimensional datasets.               |
| **Naive Bayes Optimized**  | Improvements on the basic Naive Bayes to enhance performance or accuracy.                         | - Feature selection. <br> - Parameter tuning.                                                   |
| **Performance Techniques** | Methods to evaluate and improve the accuracy and efficiency of models.                            | - Cross-validation. <br> - Precision, Recall, F1 Score. <br> - ROC curve, AUC.                  |
| **K-nearest Neighbors**    | Classify based on the majority class of 'k' closest data points.                                  | - Non-parametric. <br> - Lazy learner (no explicit training phase).                             |
| **Decision Tree**          | Tree-like model of decisions. Nodes represent tests on attributes; leaves represent class labels. | - Can handle both categorical & numerical data. <br> - Prone to overfitting.                    |
| **Linear Regression**      | Predict continuous values based on linear relationships between variables.                        | - Assumes linear relationship. <br> - Coefficient determination (R^2) measures goodness of fit. |
| **Logistic Regression**    | Predict probabilities of categorical outcomes using a logistic function.                          | - Binary or multinomial classification. <br> - Outputs probabilities.                           |
| **Support Vector Machine** | Find the hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes.                                     | - Effective in high-dimensional spaces. <br> - Uses kernel trick for non-linear data.           |

| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **K-means**                            | Partitioning method that divides a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subsets (or clusters). | - Iterative algorithm. <br> - Minimizes within-cluster variance. <br> - Requires specifying the number of clusters (K) beforehand.                                     |
| **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** | Factorization technique that decomposes a matrix into three other matrices.                        | - Used for dimensionality reduction. <br> - Commonly used in recommendation systems (e.g., collaborative filtering). <br> - Captures the underlying structure in data. |
