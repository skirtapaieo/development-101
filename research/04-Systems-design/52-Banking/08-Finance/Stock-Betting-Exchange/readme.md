## Algorithms for matching

For stock exchanges, the goal is to match buy and sell orders for a specific stock at specific prices. The primary attributes are stock type and price. Algorithms like the Continuous Double Auction are commonly used in these systems.

The matching algorithms provided below and their descriptions offer a comprehensive understanding of how order matching works in trading systems. They capture the essence of how financial markets prioritize and match orders. However, a deeper exploration reveals several interesting nuances and challenges inherent to this process.

1. **Market Dynamics and Fairness**: The choice of a matching algorithm can have profound impacts on market dynamics. For example, while FIFO seems inherently fair, it can be gamed by traders using high-frequency trading algorithms to get their orders to the front of the queue. The more complex the algorithm, the more potential there might be for unintended consequences or for savvy traders to find and exploit inefficiencies.

2. **Partial Orders and Minimum Fill**: Handling of partial orders can be quite complex. For instance, an order might specify a minimum fill amount, meaning it should either be filled for at least a certain quantity or not at all. This introduces additional constraints into the matching algorithm.

3. **Latency**: Especially in modern electronic markets, latency plays a significant role. High-frequency traders compete to have the lowest possible latency. Their algorithms might make decisions in microseconds, and even tiny advantages in speed can lead to significant profits. This makes the efficiency of a matching algorithm incredibly important.

4. **Order Types**: There are many different order types other than just simple limit and market orders. For example, stop orders, trailing stops, iceberg orders, and more. Each of these order types can introduce its own complexities into the matching algorithm.

5. **Ride-hailing vs. Stock Exchange Matching**: The analogy with ride-hailing is interesting. At a high level, both systems are trying to match supply with demand. However, the specific constraints and objectives are quite different. In ride-hailing, the primary goal is often to minimize wait time and travel distance. In stock exchanges, the goals are to ensure fairness, maximize liquidity, and provide transparent pricing. The algorithms required for these two problems, while conceptually similar, would differ in their details.

6. **Regulation and Transparency**: Stock exchanges are heavily regulated, and the choice of a matching algorithm might be constrained by regulatory requirements. Additionally, the algorithm used, and its rules and priorities, need to be transparent to all market participants to ensure a level playing field.

7. **Economic Impacts**: The choice of matching algorithm can have wider economic impacts. For example, it can influence traders' strategies, impact market liquidity, and even play a role in larger market phenomena like flash crashes.

In conclusion, while the principles behind order matching might seem straightforward, the actual implementation and the decision of which algorithm to use are far from trivial. It's a balance of ensuring fairness, maintaining market integrity, regulatory compliance, and optimizing for efficiency and speed. The detailed nuances and the high stakes involved in financial markets make order matching a fascinating and challenging problem.

### Overview

While the principles behind these order matching algorithms are well-understood and widely known, the specific implementations used by financial exchanges are often proprietary and not open source. This is because these systems are a key part of an exchange's competitive advantage. They invest significant resources in creating high-performance, low-latency systems that can handle large volumes of trades accurately and reliably.

However, there are open source trading platforms available that implement basic versions of these algorithms. For instance, platforms like Catalyst, Lean, Backtrader, and Gekko all have built-in support for backtesting trading strategies, and some of these platforms include rudimentary order matching systems.

Do note that while these open source platforms can be useful for testing trading strategies or for learning about how trading systems work, they may not be suitable for use in a production environment. They may not have the same performance characteristics or reliability as proprietary systems used by professional financial exchanges.

If you're looking to implement your own matching engine, you would typically start with a basic algorithm like FIFO or price/time priority, and then add additional features as necessary. This would be a complex undertaking, and it would require a deep understanding of both the algorithmic and the infrastructure aspects of trading systems.

As for concurrency control and ensuring that orders aren't matched more than once, this is typically handled through careful system design and the use of transactional databases or other mechanisms to ensure atomicity and isolation of operations.

It's also important to consider the regulatory environment in which the exchange operates, as there may be specific rules and requirements about how trades must be matched and reported.

### Examples

In the world of financial trading systems, the matching engine is a critical component that handles the task of matching buy and sell orders. There are several different algorithms or order matching rules that these engines can follow, each with its own set of advantages and rules.

Here are a few commonly used ones:

1. **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)**: This is the simplest and most intuitive rule. The first order to arrive gets priority over others. If a sell order arrives that matches with multiple buy orders, the one which came in first will get matched.

2. **Pro-Rata**: This rule gives priority to orders with larger sizes. If a sell order arrives that can be matched with multiple buy orders, the one with the largest size will get priority. If two orders have the same size, then it falls back to FIFO.

3. **Price/Time Priority**: This rule gives priority firstly to the best price; for orders with the same price, it falls back to the time priority (FIFO). This is one of the most common rules and is believed to be fair since it rewards both price competitiveness and early order placement.

4. **Price/Size/Time Priority**: This is a variation of the Price/Time priority rule. It gives the first priority to the best price, then to the larger size and finally to the time priority.

5. **Top of the book (TOB)**: This rule matches incoming orders against the best opposing order available. If multiple orders share the same best price, priority is typically given on a time basis (i.e., the order that arrived first).

6. **Auction or Call Market**: In this method, all buy and sell orders are collected over a certain period and then matched at a single price that maximizes the volume of trades. This method is often used in less liquid markets or at the opening/closing of exchanges.

In the case of partial order matching, the algorithms will usually match the portion of the order that can be filled, and the remainder of the order stays in the book until it can be filled or until it is cancelled.

Implementing these algorithms accurately and efficiently, and in a way that they can operate with low latency and high throughput, is a major technical challenge in building a trading system. Different exchanges might use different variations and combinations of these rules to meet their specific requirements.

Please note that this is a high-level example and a real system would likely require a more detailed and comprehensive data model and set of APIs.

Sure, here's the full information model considering the last additions:

Again, this is a simplified model for illustrative purposes. A real-world trading system would involve many more details and edge cases to consider.

## Architectural approach

The design from front-end to back-end needs to be synchronized.

Driven by non-functional requirements to breaking down those first - to look for initial issues that might arise based on the millions of users and trades ...

Let's say that worst case there are 100,000 simultaneous users, that wants to follow some or a a lot of markets.

The majority of trades during the day is with 8 hours (8x3600 sec) with some peaks during the trading day - 2-3 trades/second - with peaks on 100s of orders per second.

It is easy to get into a situation where you over-optimize, but it is worth to consider a few of these things upfront.

And to go through the design end-to-end a few times before starting to iterate.

### Front-end

The initial thinking should be on rendering approach:

#### Rendering approaches

Sure, here's a comparison table of the different rendering approaches:

| Rendering Approach                        | Strengths                                                                                                                          | Weaknesses                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**           | Smooth interaction after initial load. Flexible for dynamic content. Good for apps where SEO is not a priority.                    | Slow initial load. May impact SEO as crawlers may not execute or wait for JavaScript. Not optimal for low latency needs due to round-trip requirement for each interaction.          |
| **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**           | Faster initial page load. Better SEO as the entire page's content is available to crawlers from the outset.                        | Increased server load. Page isn't interactive until all necessary JavaScript has loaded and run. May not be optimal for real-time updates as it requires a round trip to the server. |
| **Static Site Generation (SSG)**          | Fastest initial load time. Best SEO, as all content is available at load time. Low server load as pages are pre-generated.         | Not suitable for real-time updates or pages with content that changes frequently.                                                                                                    |
| **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** | Benefits of SSG while also being able to serve dynamic content. Good SEO and performance.                                          | Only available with certain frameworks (like Next.js). Not ideal for extremely frequent updates.                                                                                     |
| **Hybrid Rendering**                      | Balances CSR and SSR to optimize for both performance and interactivity. Allows for real-time updates in certain parts of the app. | Complexity in implementation. Might still have slower initial load time compared to SSG or ISR.                                                                                      |

Given your requirement for low latency between the client and the trading systems to make the market as fair as possible, a hybrid rendering approach could be a good fit. This approach allows for real-time updates and interactions after the initial page load and reduces the need for frequent round trips to the server. You could also explore using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for pushing real-time updates from the server to the client, which could further reduce latency and enhance the user experience.

#### Efficient data handling

Implementing efficient data handling such as paginations, infinite scrolling, and lazy loading

##### Debouncing and throttling

If your application makes requests to the server as the user types into a field (for example, for autocomplete functionality), it can result in a large number of unnecessary requests. To avoid this, you can use debouncing or throttling.

Debouncing ensures that a function will not be executed until a certain amount of time has passed since it was last called. This can be useful for functions that react to user input, like search box autocomplete or form auto-saving features.

```JavaScript
let timer;
function debounce(func, delay) {
  return function(...args) {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => func.apply(this, args), delay);
  }
}

const debouncedSearch = debounce(searchFunc, 300);

input.addEventListener('input', debouncedSearch);
```

Throttling on the other hand ensures that a function is only called at most once in a specified period of time period.

```JavaScript
let allowFunction = true;
function throttle(func, limit) {
  return function(...args) {
    if (allowFunction) {
      func.apply(this, args);
      allowFunction = false;
      setTimeout(() => allowFunction = true, limit);
    }
  }
}

const throttledScroll = throttle(scrollFunc, 300);

window.addEventListener('scroll', throttledScroll);

```

##### Pagination and infinite scrolling

If the list a large, like a list of stocks:

```JavaScript
function getPage(pageNumber, pageSize) {
  fetch(`/api/stocks?page=${pageNumber}&size=${pageSize}`)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => displayData(data));
}
```

#### Caching

Client-side caching for data that doesn't change a lot

```JavaScript
const cache = {};

function getDataWithCaching(url) {
  if (cache[url]) {
    return Promise.resolve(cache[url]);
  } else {
    return fetch(url)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        cache[url] = data;
        return data;
      });
  }
}
```

#### Offline

Using service workers

```JavaScript
const CACHE_NAME = 'my-cache';
const FILES_TO_CACHE = [
  '/',
  '/index.html',
  '/styles.css',
  '/script.js',
];

self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open(CACHE_NAME)
      .then((cache) => cache.addAll(FILES_TO_CACHE))
  );
});

self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request)
      .then((response) => response || fetch(event.request))
  );
});
```

<br>

### API/Communication protocol

Certainly, let's expand the comparison table to include security measures, low bandwidth measures, and real-time capabilities:

The communication protocol and data handling systems are crucial for a stock exchange. Here's why:

**Real-Time Updates:** Stock prices fluctuate constantly throughout a trading day. Real-time or near-real-time updates are essential for providing accurate data to users. The choice of communication protocol plays a crucial role in determining the speed and reliability of these updates.

**Scalability:** Stock exchanges can have millions of users and even more daily transactions. The chosen protocols and systems need to be able to scale to handle this load without impacting performance or reliability.

**Resilience:** Financial transactions are critical operations that require a high degree of reliability and data consistency. The systems and protocols used must be resilient to failures and provide guarantees about data consistency.

**Security:** Given the sensitive nature of financial data and transactions, security is paramount. The protocols and systems must provide strong security measures to protect against various types of attacks and unauthorized access.

**Latency:** In stock trading, even a few seconds of delay can make a huge difference. High-frequency trading, for instance, relies on extremely low latency. Protocols with less overhead and faster data transmission like gRPC, WebSockets, or even proprietary protocols might be preferred for such use cases.

**Bandwidth Usage:** Considering the volume of real-time data being transmitted, the protocol should also be efficient in terms of bandwidth usage. Protocols that support features like data compression and binary data transmission can help reduce bandwidth usage.

To sum up, the choice of communication protocols and data handling systems can greatly impact the performance, reliability, scalability, and security of a stock exchange. Therefore, these considerations are very important. However, the "best" choices depend on the specific requirements, constraints, and trade-offs of your application.

Again, keep in mind that this table is a simplification and might not capture all the subtleties of these protocols/systems. And just because a protocol supports a feature doesn't necessarily mean it's the best choice for that feature. Each of these protocols/systems has its own strengths and trade-offs, and you'll need to carefully evaluate them based on your specific needs and constraints.

#### Layer orientation

In an application such as a stock exchange platform with millions of customers and trades each day, the protocols that operate at the network and transport layers (Layer 3 and Layer 4 of the OSI model) play an essential role, even if it may not be directly apparent.

Layer 3 (Network Layer) protocols like IP (Internet Protocol) handle routing and transferring data from one network to another, which is crucial for the Internet to function.

Layer 4 (Transport Layer) protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) handle the transmission of data between systems, providing services like error-checking, data ordering, and flow control.

Without these layers, communication between your servers and your customers would not be possible. These layers form the bedrock upon which higher-level protocols like HTTP, WebSocket, or gRPC (which provide the functionality your application directly uses) are built.

That being said, from an application design perspective, you may not need to directly manage these lower-layer protocols. Your networking infrastructure and your chosen high-level protocol will handle these details for you. For example, when you decide to use HTTP/2, you're implicitly choosing to use TCP at the transport layer. Similarly, when you use QUIC (which HTTP/3 is based on), you're implicitly choosing to use UDP.

However, understanding these lower layers can help you make more informed decisions about your high-level protocol choice. For example, if you need ultra-low-latency communication, you might prefer a protocol that uses UDP (like QUIC) over one that uses TCP. But if reliable data delivery is more important, a protocol that uses TCP might be a better choice.

So, in short, even though you might not directly work with Layer 3 and Layer 4 protocols, they still play an important role in your application. Your main focus should likely be on selecting and implementing the right high-level protocol that best meets your specific requirements and constraints.

### Back-end considerations

Sure, here is a tabular view of some of the back-end considerations for designing a high-performance, scalable stock exchange system:

| Consideration                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **System Architecture**            | Determine if a monolithic, microservices, or hybrid architecture best fits the application. Microservices can offer more flexibility and scalability but may be more complex to manage.                  |
| **Performance**                    | Choose a language and framework known for high performance, especially in terms of throughput and latency. Examples include C++, Rust, Java, and Go.                                                     |
| **Concurrency Model**              | Select a language that can handle a high volume of simultaneous connections efficiently. Languages with native support for async I/O or lightweight threads/coroutines could be beneficial.              |
| **Ecosystem**                      | Consider the libraries, frameworks, and tools available in the language's ecosystem, which can help accelerate development and ensure better code quality.                                               |
| **Development Speed**              | Higher-level languages like Python or Ruby might offer faster development cycles but may lack in raw performance. Consider a balance between development speed and performance.                          |
| **Maintainability**                | Choose a language that promotes a codebase easy to understand, modify, and maintain. Static typing can improve maintainability by catching many errors at compile time.                                  |
| **Scalability**                    | The language's runtime characteristics can impact the ease of scaling the system. Consider how the language handles multi-core processors, large memory handling, or a large number of open connections. |
| **Team Expertise**                 | Consider the team's familiarity and expertise with the language. Even the best language features can be useless if your team is not comfortable with the language.                                       |
| **Data Consistency**               | The system must provide strong consistency guarantees, avoiding race conditions or concurrency issues leading to data inconsistency.                                                                     |
| **Fault Tolerance and Resilience** | Design the system to handle failures gracefully, minimize downtime, and recover quickly. Use patterns like circuit breakers, retries, rate limiting, etc.                                                |
| **Security**                       | Implement best practices for security, including strong measures for authentication, authorization, encryption, and regular security audits.                                                             |
| **Database Optimization**          | Ensure your databases are optimized to handle high volumes of read and write operations, using techniques like indexing, sharding, and replication.                                                      |
| **Caching and CDN**                | Implement server-side caching and use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache responses closer to the user, reducing latency and improving performance.                                                |

Remember, these are some of the considerations, and the specifics will depend on the exact requirements, constraints, and trade-offs of your project.

#### Language alternatives

Sure, here is how C, a lower-level language, could compare to Node.js and Go with regards to these considerations:

| Consideration                      | Description                                                                                  | Node.js                                                                                                                                                                      | Go                                                                                                                                                                                     | C                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **System Architecture**            | Determines if a monolithic, microservices, or hybrid architecture best fits the application. | Node.js can support all types of architectures. However, it shines in microservices due to its event-driven nature and lightweight runtime.                                  | Go is also a great fit for microservices due to its simplicity, performance, and built-in support for concurrency.                                                                     | C doesn't naturally lend itself to the microservices architecture, but it's possible with proper abstractions and discipline.                                                                       |
| **Performance**                    | Raw speed and efficiency of the language.                                                    | Node.js is not the fastest language due to its interpreted nature, but its event-driven, non-blocking model can handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently. | Go is a compiled language that is known for its high performance. It can handle CPU-intensive tasks much better than Node.js.                                                          | C is a lower-level language, and it can be extremely efficient in terms of raw speed. It's possible to optimize C code to a very high degree.                                                       |
| **Concurrency Model**              | Ability to handle simultaneous connections or tasks.                                         | Node.js has an event-driven model with asynchronous I/O, which can efficiently handle a large number of concurrent connections.                                              | Go has built-in support for lightweight threads (goroutines), which makes it excellent for tasks that require high concurrency.                                                        | C does not provide built-in support for concurrency, but it can be achieved using multi-threading with libraries such as Pthreads.                                                                  |
| **Ecosystem**                      | Libraries, frameworks, and tools available.                                                  | Node.js has a vast ecosystem with packages available for almost any task, thanks to npm. Express.js is a widely used framework for building web applications.                | Go's ecosystem is not as large as Node.js, but it's growing. For web development, there are frameworks like Gin and Echo.                                                              | C's ecosystem is vast and mature, but it lacks modern web development frameworks that Node.js and Go have.                                                                                          |
| **Development Speed**              | How quickly can we develop and iterate?                                                      | JavaScript is widely known and used, which can accelerate development. Also, Node.js has a shorter feedback loop due to its interpreted nature.                              | Go is easy to learn and use, which could lead to fast development. However, its compile-run cycle could be slower than Node.js.                                                        | C development can be slow due to its low-level nature. It requires manual memory management, and its compile-link-run cycle can be lengthy.                                                         |
| **Maintainability**                | Ease of maintaining and evolving code.                                                       | JavaScript is dynamically typed, which may lead to runtime errors. TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, introduces static typing and can improve maintainability.           | Go is statically typed, which can reduce runtime errors and improve maintainability. Its syntax is simple and easy to read.                                                            | C code can be difficult to maintain due to its low-level nature. It lacks high-level abstractions and requires careful memory management.                                                           |
| **Scalability**                    | How does the language handle growth in data, traffic, or complexity?                         | Node.js can scale well, especially in I/O-bound tasks. However, CPU-bound tasks can block the Node.js event loop and degrade performance.                                    | Go is excellent for scalability. It performs well for both I/O-bound and CPU-bound tasks, and goroutines allow efficient use of multi-core processors.                                 | C can scale well in terms of performance, but it requires more manual work compared to Node.js or Go. It doesn't provide built-in support for I/O-bound scalability.                                |
| **Team Expertise**                 | Familiarity and expertise of the team with the language.                                     | JavaScript is one of the most popular languages and many developers have experience with it.                                                                                 | Go is less widely known compared to JavaScript, so your team might need to learn it, which could slow down initial development.                                                        | C is a classic language that many developers learn early on, but its low-level nature and complexity mean that it requires a higher level of expertise to use effectively in large applications.    |
| **Data Consistency**               | Ability to avoid race conditions or concurrency issues leading to data inconsistency.        | JavaScript is single-threaded, which eliminates many (but not all) concurrency-related issues. However, care must be taken to handle async operations properly.              | Go has built-in support for concurrent programming. However, ensuring data consistency requires careful handling of synchronization between goroutines.                                | C provides low-level mechanisms for managing concurrency, like mutexes, which can ensure data consistency. However, it requires a great deal of care and expertise to use correctly.                |
| **Fault Tolerance and Resilience** | Ability to handle and recover from errors and failures.                                      | Node.js does not have built-in features for this. Libraries like circuit-breaker-js can be used to implement these patterns.                                                 | Go's simplicity and strong static typing make it easier to write correct code. For more advanced fault tolerance, external libraries or patterns would need to be used.                | C lacks built-in features for fault tolerance and resilience. However, with its low-level access, developers can build custom solutions, albeit at a cost of increased complexity.                  |
| **Security**                       | Strength and ease of implementing secure applications.                                       | Node.js has well-known security modules like helmet and express-rate-limit. However, JavaScript's flexibility can also lead to security risks if not used carefully.         | Go is a statically-typed and compiled language, which reduces the risk of many common programmer mistakes. However, like any other language, secure coding practices must be followed. | C is powerful, but it's also easy to make serious security mistakes. Buffer overflows, underflows, and memory leaks are common security issues. Careful coding and extensive testing are necessary. |
| **Database Optimization**          | Language support for database operations and optimizations.                                  | Node.js supports a wide range of databases, both SQL and NoSQL, via ORMs like Sequelize or Mongoose.                                                                         | Go has several libraries for database access and supports SQL and NoSQL databases. However, ORMs are not as common in the Go ecosystem.                                                | C can interact with almost any database, but                                                                                                                                                        |

it usually requires writing low-level code or using a library. There is no standard ORM-like tool for C. |
| **Caching and CDN** | Ability to work with caching systems and CDNs. | Node.js can use in-memory data stores like Redis for caching and can interact with CDNs for static content delivery. | Go can also work with caching systems like Redis and CDNs. Its performance and concurrent processing capabilities make it a good fit for cache-heavy applications. | C can use caching systems and CDNs, but it usually requires lower-level, more complex code compared to Node.js or Go. |

Please note that the decision to use C should be considered very carefully due to its low-level nature, which can increase complexity and potential security risks. For many web applications, Node.js or Go (or other high-level languages) are more suitable. However, if maximum performance is crucial and the team has strong C expertise, it could be a viable choice.

#### Breaking points?

In a high-volume application like a stock exchange where there could be millions or tens of millions of trades each day, both the language choice and the infrastructure can be critical.

When comparing Node.js to Go in this scenario, there are some potential breaking points to consider:

1. **Concurrency**: Node.js uses a single-threaded event-driven architecture, which can handle a large number of concurrent connections. However, if there are CPU-bound tasks, they could potentially block the event loop and degrade performance. Go, on the other hand, has built-in support for lightweight threads (goroutines) and a strong concurrency model, making it capable of handling CPU-intensive tasks along with high concurrency requirements effectively.

2. **Performance**: Go, being a statically-typed compiled language, generally provides better performance than Node.js, especially for CPU-intensive operations. If your application requires a high level of computational tasks, Go may be a better choice.

3. **Scaling**: As the load increases, you might find that you need more instances of Node.js running to keep up with the demand, whereas you might need fewer instances of Go due to its better performance and efficiency.

However, language is just one part of the equation. The infrastructure also plays a significant role in how your application can scale and handle the load. Things like database design and optimization, load balancing, caching strategies, and how you distribute your microservices can greatly impact the system's overall performance and ability to handle large loads.

Cloud services, like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, provide tools and services that can help manage load, scale your application, and monitor performance, which can be just as important as your language choice. For example, using auto-scaling groups can help ensure that you have the right number of instances running to handle the current load. Similarly, using a load balancer can help distribute traffic evenly across your instances, preventing any single instance from becoming a bottleneck.

In conclusion, both Node.js and Go can be used to build a high-volume application like a stock exchange. The choice between them depends on your specific use case, the nature of the tasks your application performs, and your team's expertise. However, irrespective of the language you choose, proper infrastructure planning and optimization is crucial to handle the load efficiently and provide a smooth user experience.

Remember, the choice of services will be driven by your specific use case, cost, team expertise, and preferences. The above are just recommendations and starting points.

#### Additional infrastructure due to API/communication protocols

Yes, depending on the API/communication protocols that you choose, there could be some additional considerations and services you might need to include:

1. **API Gateway**: If you're using REST or GraphQL over HTTP/HTTPS, you would need an API Gateway service to manage, secure, and throttle your APIs. In AWS, this could be the Amazon API Gateway; in Azure, it's the Azure API Management; and in Google Cloud, it's the Apigee API Platform.

2. **WebSocket support**: If you choose to use WebSocket, you'd need to make sure your load balancer and other networking components support WebSocket connections. AWS API Gateway and Application Load Balancer, Azure API Management and Application Gateway, and Google Cloud Load Balancer all support WebSocket connections.

3. **Serverless computing**: If you're planning on using Server-Sent Events (SSE), your infrastructure would need to support long-lived HTTP connections. This might influence your choice of compute service. For instance, AWS Lambda, a serverless computing service, has a maximum execution duration per request of 15 minutes as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, which could be a constraint for long-lived SSE connections.

4. **gRPC support**: If you're considering gRPC, you'll need to ensure your infrastructure supports HTTP/2, as gRPC is built on top of it. Google Cloud's load balancers and Cloud Endpoints support HTTP/2 and gRPC. Azure's Application Gateway and API Management recently added support for gRPC and HTTP/2 as well. In AWS, the Application Load Balancer and Network Load Balancer support HTTP/2, but as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, AWS's API Gateway does not natively support gRPC, though there are workarounds using AWS Lambda and a proxy server.

5. **Real-time updates**: If you require real-time updates (like price changes or trade confirmations) pushed to your clients, you might also need a real-time messaging service. AWS offers Simple Notification Service (SNS) and AppSync (for real-time GraphQL), Azure has Azure SignalR Service, and Google Cloud has Pub/Sub.

6. **Security**: Regardless of the protocols used, the security of your APIs is crucial. Consider using services like AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall), Azure Front Door (which includes WAF), or Google Cloud Armor to protect your APIs.

7. **Monitoring**: Monitoring the performance and usage of your APIs is also essential. Consider using API-specific monitoring and tracing tools like AWS X-Ray, Azure Application Insights, or Google Cloud Trace.

These additional components should integrate well with the previously mentioned infrastructure, enhancing your ability to create and maintain a secure, scalable, and efficient trading platform.

### Security layers

Security is an essential aspect of any application, especially when dealing with financial transactions and sensitive user data. There are various components of security you need to consider, including user authentication, data security, network security, and ensuring the application is resistant to common web vulnerabilities.

**Front-end (React/JavaScript)**

1. **User Authentication**: Implement secure user authentication. OAuth 2.0 is a standard protocol for authentication that's used by many providers, including Google. Libraries like Passport.js can help simplify this process.

2. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs to protect against issues like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. React mitigates most XSS issues by default, as it escapes content in JSX before rendering.

3. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS, not HTTP, to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

4. **Secure data storage**: Avoid storing sensitive data in local storage or session storage. If a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack occurs, the attacker could access this data.

5. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement a CSP to prevent certain types of attacks, like XSS and data injection attacks.

**API (Protocol Buffers)**

1. **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: Use Transport Layer Security (TLS) for all communications to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data in transit.

2. **Access Control**: Ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access your APIs.

3. **Rate limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of your APIs.

4. **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs to your API to protect against attacks like SQL injection. If using Protocol Buffers, schema validation is done automatically, reducing the risk.

**Infrastructure (Google Cloud)**

1. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Use Google Cloud's IAM for controlling access to your cloud resources. Implement the principle of least privilege—give a user or service account only those permissions necessary to perform their job.

2. **Firewall**: Configure firewalls to control who can access your systems. Google Cloud Armor provides DDOS protection and a web application firewall.

3. **Encryption**: Google Cloud encrypts customer data stored at rest by default, and offers options for customer-managed encryption keys.

4. **Audit Logs**: Use Google Cloud's audit logs to keep track of who did what, when, and where.

5. **Regular updates and patches**: Make sure all your services are up-to-date and apply patches regularly.

Remember, security is a vast and complex topic and these are just some of the considerations. It's always recommended to have a security expert involved when designing the architecture for an application dealing with sensitive user data and financial transactions.

### Regulatory compliance

Regulatory compliance is a critical aspect of building and maintaining a stock exchange platform. The specific requirements may vary depending on the jurisdiction your platform operates in, but some general strategies to achieve and maintain compliance are:

1. **Data Protection**: Understand the data protection laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. If your users are from the European Union, you will need to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If they are from California in the US, you will need to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Implement necessary measures to ensure user data is protected and users are able to exercise their rights.

2. **Financial Regulations**: As a stock exchange platform, there will be specific financial regulations you must follow, like SEC regulations in the US. Compliance with these regulations can be complex and might involve aspects like reporting, transparency, fair trading practices, etc. It's advisable to work with a legal team that specializes in financial regulation.

3. **Security Standards**: Compliance with security standards like ISO 27001 or the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) can also be important, depending on your business model. Compliance with these standards can help protect user data and reduce the risk of breaches.

4. **Auditability**: Ensure that your systems are designed to capture the necessary data and preserve it in a way that supports audit requirements. This often involves keeping detailed logs of activities and changes.

5. **Infrastructure Compliance**: If you're using Google Cloud Platform, ensure your infrastructure complies with the necessary standards and regulations. Google Cloud provides several compliance offerings including ISO/IEC 27001 for information security management, ISO/IEC 27017 for cloud security, ISO/IEC 27018 for privacy, SOC 2 for controls relevant to security, availability, and confidentiality, and more.

6. **Continuous Monitoring and Review**: Compliance isn't a one-time process. Regular monitoring and review of your systems and practices are needed to ensure ongoing compliance, particularly as laws and regulations evolve over time.

Please note that this advice is very general, and the specifics will depend on your situation and jurisdiction. Consult with a lawyer or compliance expert to make sure you're meeting all necessary legal and regulatory requirements.

Sure, here's a table that aligns the data management, data pipeline, and analytics/reporting components, considering infrastructure, front-end, and back-end aspects.

| Component                   | Consideration            | Google Cloud Services                                                           | React/JavaScript                                                                | Go                                                                                  | Communication Protocol |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Data Management**         | Data Ingestion           | Pub/Sub (real-time event ingestion), Cloud Storage (large scale file ingestion) | Fetch API/Axios (for making HTTP requests to ingest data)                       | Use standard library for HTTP requests, Google Cloud client libraries for ingestion | HTTP/2, gRPC           |
|                             | Data Transformation      | Dataflow (both stream and batch processing), Cloud Dataprep (for data cleaning) | Data is usually transformed in the backend                                      | Use standard libraries or third-party packages for data transformation              | Protobuf, Avro         |
|                             | Data Storage             | BigQuery (Data Warehousing), Firestore or Cloud SQL (operational databases)     | Not directly interacting with these services, but can request data through APIs | Google Cloud client libraries for interaction with storage services                 | HTTP/2, gRPC           |
| **Data Pipeline**           | Real-time data handling  | Pub/Sub, Dataflow                                                               | WebSocket API for real-time data display                                        | gorilla/websocket for handling WebSocket connections                                | WebSocket, SSE         |
|                             | Batch data handling      | Dataflow, Dataproc (for Apache Spark and Hadoop)                                | Not directly interacting with these services, but can request data through APIs | Google Cloud client libraries for interaction                                       | HTTP/2, gRPC           |
| **Analytics and Reporting** | Data Analysis            | BigQuery (for big data analytics)                                               | Fetch API/Axios for requesting analytical data                                  | Google Cloud client libraries for interaction with BigQuery                         | HTTP/2, gRPC           |
|                             | Reporting/Visualizations | Data Studio, Looker                                                             | Use libraries like D3.js, Recharts, etc. for data visualization on the frontend | Primarily a front-end concern, Go will serve processed data for visualizations      | HTTP/2                 |
|                             | Real-time Analytics      | BigQuery (for real-time analytics), Pub/Sub, Dataflow                           | WebSocket API for real-time data display                                        | gorilla/websocket for handling WebSocket connections                                | WebSocket, SSE         |

It's important to note that not every tool or service is used directly with every technology. For instance, front-end code in React may not interact directly with BigQuery or Dataflow, but would instead request data via APIs from a server application written in Go, which does interact with these services.

### Operations, monitoring and alerts (and support)

Each of these tools can play a key role in maintaining high velocity while keeping quality high. They support iterative development, automation, collaboration, and provide insight into the application and infrastructure, enabling teams to catch and resolve issues quickly.

### Testing

Testing is a critical aspect of any application lifecycle, including stock exchange systems. A well-structured testing strategy is important for ensuring the functionality, performance, and security of your application. Here are some key areas of testing and the corresponding tools you might use:

| Testing Area            | React/JavaScript                                                                                                   | Go                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Unit Testing**        | Jest (JavaScript testing framework), Enzyme (React testing library), React Testing Library (alternative to Enzyme) | Go's built-in testing package, Testify (third-party library providing additional features) |
| **Integration Testing** | Jest, Supertest (HTTP assertions), nock (HTTP server mocking)                                                      | Go's built-in testing and net/http/httptest packages                                       |
| **End-to-End Testing**  | Cypress (browser-based end-to-end testing), Puppeteer (headless browser for automated testing)                     | Agouti (Webdriver for Go)                                                                  |
| **Performance Testing** | Lighthouse (performance audits for web apps), Sitespeed.io (website speed testing)                                 | Vegeta (HTTP load testing), Go's built-in benchmarking support                             |
| **Security Testing**    | OWASP ZAP (automated security scanning), npm audit (checks for vulnerabilities in Node.js dependencies)            | GoSec (inspects Go source code for security problems)                                      |

For each of these testing stages, you'd define test cases that cover the different parts of your application, such as various user interactions, data processing, and data persistence.

In a DevOps or Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) environment, these tests would be run automatically in your pipeline to catch any issues before they reach production. Google Cloud's Cloud Build can be configured to run these tests at each stage of your pipeline.
