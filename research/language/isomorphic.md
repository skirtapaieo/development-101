# Isomorphic JavaScript

## Why should I care about Isomorphic JavaScript?

Isomorphic JavaScript refers to JavaScript code that can run both on the client-side and the server-side. Similar to Universal JavaScript, it allows for better code reuse, improved performance, and SEO benefits. The term is often used interchangeably with Universal JavaScript.

## Who created Isomorphic JavaScript?

The concept of Isomorphic JavaScript is a community-driven idea and is not attributed to a specific individual or organization. It gained traction with the advent of Node.js and server-side JavaScript frameworks.

## Why the name Isomorphic JavaScript?

The term "Isomorphic" is derived from mathematics and is used to describe two objects that are essentially "the same shape." In this context, it means that the JavaScript code can run in two different environments but behave similarly.

## Why Isomorphic JavaScript was created?

Isomorphic JavaScript emerged to solve the issue of duplicating logic on the client and the server, reducing the overall codebase and making it easier to maintain and manage.

## How and when was Isomorphic JavaScript started?

The concept started gaining attention around the early to mid-2010s, largely due to the rise of Node.js and frameworks that support running the same JavaScript code on both client and server.

## Who uses Isomorphic JavaScript?

Companies that require fast initial page loads, SEO benefits, and a maintainable codebase often employ Isomorphic JavaScript. This can include e-commerce sites, media platforms, and large-scale web applications.

## What are the things that people say Isomorphic JavaScript needs to improve?

1. **Complexity**: Balancing code for both server and client can be complex.
2. **Debugging**: Tracing errors across client and server may be challenging.

## What are the main alternatives to Isomorphic JavaScript?

1. **Static Site Generators**: Like Jekyll or Hugo for simpler, static sites.
2. **Client-Only Single Page Applications (SPA)**.

## Overview of the Isomorphic JavaScript stack

- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime for JavaScript.
- **Express.js**: A popular server framework for Node.js.
- **React/Next.js, Angular Universal, Nuxt.js**: Frameworks that support Isomorphic JavaScript.

Isomorphic JavaScript offers a unified approach to web development, bringing together the best aspects of both client-side and server-side programming. It's particularly useful for web applications that demand high performance, SEO, and maintainability.
