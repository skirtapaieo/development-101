## Conceptual Explanation of Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo simulation is a computational technique that allows you to account for uncertainty in your predictions and decision-making processes. Essentially, it's like performing a "what-if" analysis on a grand scale. The method involves the following steps:

1. **Identify Variables and Distributions**: Identify the variables that have inherent uncertainty or variability. Assign probability distributions to these variables.

2. **Generate Random Samples**: Generate a set of random samples for each variable based on its assigned probability distribution.

3. **Perform Simulation**: For each set of random samples, run a deterministic model or calculation. This will give you a single outcome.

4. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 multiple times—often thousands or even millions of times—to build up a distribution of possible outcomes.

5. **Analyze Results**: Use statistical methods to understand the distribution of outcomes, estimate probabilities, and make informed decisions.

### Tangible Example: Investment Portfolio Risk Assessment

Imagine you're an investor, and you want to assess the risk associated with a portfolio consisting of three stocks: A, B, and C. The annual returns for these stocks are uncertain and can be modeled with specific probability distributions.

#### Steps:

1. **Identify Variables and Distributions**:
    - Stock A has an expected annual return of 8% with a standard deviation of 4%.
    - Stock B has an expected annual return of 6% with a standard deviation of 2%.
    - Stock C has an expected annual return of 10% with a standard deviation of 5%.

2. **Generate Random Samples**: Generate random samples for the annual returns of each stock based on their respective probability distributions.

3. **Perform Simulation**: Calculate the portfolio's overall annual return based on the random samples.

4. **Repeat**: Repeat the simulation many times to get a distribution of possible annual returns for the portfolio.

5. **Analyze Results**: Determine the probability of getting a negative return, the expected return, etc.

#### Code Example:

Here's a Python code snippet to simulate this example using Monte Carlo.

```python
import numpy as np

# Number of simulations
n_simulations = 10000

# Parameters for stocks A, B, and C
mean_returns = [0.08, 0.06, 0.10]  # Expected annual returns
std_devs = [0.04, 0.02, 0.05]  # Standard deviations

# Portfolio weights for stocks A, B, and C
weights = [0.4, 0.3, 0.3]

# Monte Carlo simulation
portfolio_returns = []

for _ in range(n_simulations):
    returns = np.random.normal(mean_returns, std_devs)
    portfolio_return = np.dot(weights, returns)
    portfolio_returns.append(portfolio_return)

# Analyze results
mean_portfolio_return = np.mean(portfolio_returns)
prob_negative_return = np.sum(np.array(portfolio_returns) < 0) / n_simulations

print(f"Mean Portfolio Return: {mean_portfolio_return}")
print(f"Probability of Negative Return: {prob_negative_return}")
```
