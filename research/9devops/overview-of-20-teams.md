
Certainly! In the table below, each row represents a team, and the columns capture different phases of the DevOps cycle. The cells describe the specific characteristics or tasks related to that phase for the team, considering their repository setup (Monorepo vs. Multiple Repos).

```markdown
| Team No | Repository Type | Planning                  | Coding              | Building            | Testing            | Deployment         | Monitoring        |

### Explanations:

1. **Team 1 - Monorepo**: 
    - **Planning**: All planning happens within the same repository using a single backlog.
    - **Coding**: The code resides in a `/src` directory.
    - **Building**: The build assets are located in a `/build` directory.
    - **Testing**: Test cases are located in a `/tests` directory.
    - **Deployment**: Code gets deployed from a `/dist` directory.
    - **Monitoring**: Metrics and monitoring setup are documented within the same repository.

2. **Team 2 - Monorepo**: 
    - **Planning**: They use GitHub issues for planning sprints.
    - **Coding**: The main application code is kept in an `/app` directory.
    - **Building**: Build scripts are located in a `/build` directory.
    - **Testing**: Unit tests are in `/tests/unit`.
    - **Deployment**: Automatic deployments occur from the master branch.
    - **Monitoring**: Log files are kept in a `/logs` directory in the repo.

3. **Team 11 - Multiple Repos**: 
    - **Planning**: A separate repository exists solely for planning.
    - **Coding**: The main code resides in its own separate repository.
    - **Building**: Building happens in a CI/CD repository.
    - **Testing**: A separate test repository is used for running tests.
    - **Deployment**: Deployment is managed in a separate repository.
    - **Monitoring**: A separate repository for monitoring exists.

4. **Team 20 - Multiple Repos**: 
    - **Planning**: Planning occurs in Asana, outside of GitHub.
    - **Coding**: Code resides in a separate repository.
    - **Building**: A Jenkins pipeline is used for building.
    - **Testing**: A separate repository is dedicated for tests.
    - **Deployment**: Deployments happen through AWS ECS.
    - **Monitoring**: Monitoring is managed through Splunk, separate from the code repositories.

The table helps to quickly understand how each team, given its repository type (Monorepo or Multiple Repos), approaches the different phases of the DevOps cycle.
