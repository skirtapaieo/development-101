#### Definition:
A monorepo (monolithic repository) is a version control strategy where a single repository contains the code for multiple projects or multiple components of a larger project. 

#### Pros:

1. **Code Sharing**: Easy to share code and assets across projects or teams, promoting reusability.
  
2. **Unified Versioning**: All code is versioned together, reducing the complexity of dependencies.
  
3. **Simplified Workflow**: Developers have a unified workflow for all projects, simplifying the build and test process.

4. **Global Refactoring**: Changes can be applied across all projects simultaneously, improving code quality.

5. **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Easier for teams to collaborate and work on shared components.

#### Cons:

1. **Large-Scale Complexity**: As more code is added, the repo can become increasingly hard to manage.
  
2. **Build Time**: Building the entire repo can be time-consuming.

3. **Learning Curve**: New team members may find it overwhelming due to the sheer size and complexity.

4. **Access Control**: More challenging to implement granular access controls on the codebase.

5. **Tooling**: Requires specialized tools to manage effectively.

### Multiple Repos (Polyrepo)

#### Definition:
In a polyrepo setup, each team or project has its own separate repository.

#### Pros:

1. **Isolation**: Teams can work in isolation, reducing the chances of merge conflicts.

2. **Focused Access**: Easier to implement granular access controls for each repo.

3. **Specialization**: Each repo can have its own customized toolchain, suited to its specific needs.

4. **Easy Onboarding**: Simpler for new team members to get acquainted with a smaller codebase.

5. **Resource Efficiency**: Faster build times and fewer resources required per repo.

#### Cons:

1. **Code Duplication**: May lead to duplication of code and assets, reducing reusability.
  
2. **Dependency Management**: Managing dependencies across multiple repos can become complex.

3. **Reduced Collaboration**: Less incentive for teams to collaborate on shared components.

4. **Fragmented Workflow**: Developers may need to get accustomed to different workflows for different repos.

5. **Versioning**: Keeping track of which versions of different repos work well together can be a challenge.

| Workflow              | Unified workflow                           | Different workflows may exist             |
| Build Time            | Can be long for large codebases            | Generally quicker, more focused           |
| Access Control        | Granular control can be challenging        | Easier to implement focused access        |
| Collaboration         | Promotes cross-team collaboration         | Teams can work more independently        |
| Dependency Management | Simplified due to unified codebase        | Can become complex across repos           |

Choosing between a monorepo and multiple repos largely depends on the specific needs of your organization and teams. Both approaches have their pros and cons, and a hybrid approach is also an option.
