Setting up a local CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) flow with different environments like development, test, staging, and production is possible. You can achieve this using GitHub and Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Below is an outline of how you can go about it.

### Tools Required

1. **GitHub**: Version control system
2. **VS Code**: Text editor
3. **Docker**: Optional, for containerization
4. **Jenkins** or **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD
5. **Live Server**: VS Code extension for a local development server

### Steps

#### 1. Initial Setup

- Create a GitHub repository and clone it locally.
- Open the cloned repository in VS Code.

#### 2. Branching Strategy

- Use `main` for production.
- Create branches for `development`, `test`, and `staging`.

```bash
git checkout -b development
git checkout -b test
git checkout -b staging
```

#### 3. Development Environment (Using Live Server)

- Install the Live Server extension in VS Code.
- Open your HTML file and click "Go Live" to start the server.

#### 4. Automated Testing (Optional)

- Configure unit tests.
- Run tests locally to verify they pass.

#### 5. Local CI/CD (Using Jenkins or GitHub Actions)

##### Jenkins

- Install Jenkins locally.
- Create a Jenkins pipeline and configure it to pull from your GitHub repository.
- Add steps for testing and deploying to different environments based on the branch.

##### GitHub Actions

- Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository.
- Add YAML files for different workflows.

#### 6. Deployment

- Manually merge code to different branches to promote it through `test`, `staging`, and `production`.

#### 7. Monitoring and Rollback

- Monitor the application in different environments.
- If anything breaks, use Git to rollback changes.

### Example GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - development
      - test
      - staging

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Deploy
        run: ./deploy.sh
```

| Initial Setup      | GitHub, VS Code     | Create repo and clone it locally.                                                                      |
| Branching Strategy | Git                 | Create branches for different environments.                                                            |
| Development        | Live Server, VS Code| Use Live Server for local development.                                                                 |
| Testing            | Jest (Optional)     | Configure and run unit tests.                                                                          |
| CI/CD              | Jenkins/GitHub Actions | Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate tests and deployments.                                             |
| Deployment         | Git                 | Manually merge code to promote it through environments.                                                |
| Monitoring         | N/A                 | Monitor and rollback if needed.                                                                        |

This should give you a good start on setting up a local CI/CD flow with different environments using GitHub and VS Code.
