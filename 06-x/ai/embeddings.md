# Embeddings

## Introduction

In the context of AI/ML, embeddings are a type of representation that is used to map discrete or categorical data into a continuous vector space. This can be useful for a variety of tasks, such as natural language processing (NLP), machine translation, and recommender systems.

## Representing words or phrases

For example, in NLP, embeddings can be used to represent words or phrases as vectors. This can be done by using a neural network to learn the relationships between words. The resulting vectors can then be used to represent the meaning of words or phrases, which can be useful for tasks such as sentiment analysis or text classification.

## Learning embeddings

Embeddings can be learned in a variety of ways, but some common methods include:

- **Word2vec:** This is a neural network model that is used to learn embeddings for words. The model is trained on a corpus of text, and it learns to predict the surrounding words for each word.
- **GloVe:** This is a statistical method that is used to learn embeddings for words. The method is based on the assumption that the co-occurrence of words in a corpus is related to their semantic similarity.
- **FastText:** This is a neural network model that is similar to Word2vec, but it can also learn embeddings for phrases.

## Choosing embeddings

The choice of embedding method depends on the specific application. For example, if the goal is to learn embeddings for words, then Word2vec or GloVe may be a good choice. If the goal is to learn embeddings for phrases, then FastText may be a good choice.

Embeddings are a powerful tool that can be used to represent data in a way that is useful for machine learning tasks. They are becoming increasingly popular in a variety of fields, and they are likely to continue to play an important role in the development of AI.

## Embeddings using Word2Vec

Sure, here is a code example to illustrate embeddings using the Word2vec model:

```python
import gensim

# Create a Word2vec model
model = gensim.models.Word2Vec(sentences, size=300, window=5, min_count=5)

# Get the embeddings for the words "king" and "queen"
king_embedding = model.wv["king"]
queen_embedding = model.wv["queen"]

# Calculate the cosine similarity between the embeddings
cosine_similarity = np.dot(king_embedding, queen_embedding) / (np.linalg.norm(king_embedding) * np.linalg.norm(queen_embedding))

# Print the cosine similarity
print(cosine_similarity)
```

This code first creates a Word2vec model. The model is trained on a corpus of text, and it learns to predict the surrounding words for each word. The size parameter specifies the number of dimensions for each embedding. The window parameter specifies the number of words to consider on either side of the target word. The min_count parameter specifies the minimum number of times a word must appear in the corpus to be included in the model.

Next, the code gets the embeddings for the words "king" and "queen". The `wv` attribute of the model returns a dictionary that maps words to their embeddings.

Finally, the code calculates the cosine similarity between the embeddings of the words "king" and "queen". The cosine similarity is a measure of the similarity between two vectors. In this case, it measures the similarity between the vector representations of the words "king" and "queen".

The output of the code will be the cosine similarity between the embeddings of the words "king" and "queen". This value is close to 1, which indicates that the two words are semantically similar.

## Embeddings using GloVe and FastText

These code examples are just a few simple examples of how embeddings can be used. There are many other ways to use embeddings, and the best way to use them depends on the specific application.

**GloVe:**

```python
import glove

# Create a GloVe model
model = glove.Glove(sentences, dim=300)

# Get the embeddings for the words "king" and "queen"
king_embedding = model.word_vectors["king"]
queen_embedding = model.word_vectors["queen"]

# Calculate the cosine similarity between the embeddings
cosine_similarity = np.dot(king_embedding, queen_embedding) / (np.linalg.norm(king_embedding) * np.linalg.norm(queen_embedding))

# Print the cosine similarity
print(cosine_similarity)
```

**FastText:**

```python
import fasttext

# Create a FastText model
model = fasttext.FastText(sentences, size=300)

# Get the embeddings for the words "king" and "queen"
king_embedding = model.get_word_vector("king")
queen_embedding = model.get_word_vector("queen")

# Calculate the cosine similarity between the embeddings
cosine_similarity = np.dot(king_embedding, queen_embedding) / (np.linalg.norm(king_embedding) * np.linalg.norm(queen_embedding))

# Print the cosine similarity
print(cosine_similarity)
```
