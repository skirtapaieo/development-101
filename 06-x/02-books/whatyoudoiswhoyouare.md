# What You Do Is Who You Are

## Summary

"What You Do Is Who You Are" is a book by Ben Horowitz, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, a private venture capital firm. The book delves into the concept of corporate culture, arguing that actions, rather than stated values, define a company's culture. Horowitz uses historical and contemporary examples to illustrate how leaders can shape culture through their actions.

## Key Points
