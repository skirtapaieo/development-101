
Hey there.

I opened this repository to do a reboot of myself.

I should  mention that I have coded, and built systems, commercially on an off since I was 13. I did a retail system, POS, inventory, warehouse, picklist, EAN-scanners, printer interfaces, code to open cash registers and so on, and all the hardware and OS-work. As I stopped doing it a while back I needed a reboot to catchup. I also do playful things in the [play-101 repo](https://github.com/skirtapaieo/play-101).

So between 2022 and Q1 2023 I did a reboot - and since March, I have started to do "commercial" development work for clients again, and my first thing was a performance framework using Python, Puppeteer, Lighthouse that tested the performance of 10 competitors and their platforms, from 3 different locations across Eurupe, that also can be used for continuous performance measurement during their continuous deployment.

If you are just here to see some code: [See README-coding.md for a few examples of coding](README-coding.md).

Lets continue.

### Product Management and UX (in private repos and clients)

I love technology but almost everything I do are "applications" and a means to an end. Product Management and UX goes hand in hand with software development. I've successfully launched products with outstanding UX and technology, the latest example is DeLaval, where we developed cloud platforms and products using AWS IoT solutions and a proprietary edge server.

I have worked as CTO/CPO, and I have done UX design for clients, in smaller setting. I am proficient in Figma and Storybook, I've worked with design systems in Vue and React, collaborated with in-house teams and agencies. The most recent thing that I have learned about is accessibility. I have done reactive programming since 2014 (Meteor).

As mentioned I have done products like retail systems, also within HR I helped Decision Dynamics with personality assessments, that sells their system to HR department. Most of these things you can find in [my LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patriksv/).


## Continuous learning through courses

I started using AlgoExpert years ago to sharpen my technical interview skills, especially for roles at top tech firms like Google and Facebook. AlgoExpert has since evolved, offering 6 courses and extensive learning in algorithms and data structure, systems design, front-end, blockchain/crypto, and machine learning. I've signed up for all courses and most of them are done now (2023). My language focus has been on JavaScript and Python - but you also learn a little about React, Go, Solidity, HTML and CSS.

I have a foundation from my education with computer science at its core with discrete mathematics, mathematical logic, logic, cognitive science, programming, database management, and operating systems but it was quite a while ago -  and in 2016 [I took a Deep Learning course at Stanford/Coursera, with Andrew Ng as teacher](https://medium.com/@skirtap/v%C3%A5r-l%C3%A4rare-i-artificiell-intelligens-p%C3%A5-stanford-tittar-ned-i-sina-papper-546af7cc774c#.ej6qy2g00), as part of their Artificial Intelligence program.

## Research

The research part is a little chaotic. When I am interested in something I research it and perhaps I do some HelloWorld thing to get a feel for it.

[AI](research/ai/readme.md) - I have a startup project in a private repo but there is some initial research here in varia few markdown files

[Application](research/applications/README.MD) - I do research front-end and back-end technology like design systems, HTML, CSS, JavaScript frameworks (RSC, Leptos, Next.JS, Nuxt, Phoenix, Angular, Turbo (Ruby), Svelte, Van, Vue). You will need to peek into the subdirectories yourself, sorry. Back-end started with Mojo, that forced me to learn more about Python, and so on. There is some basic back-end research done here.

[Data](research/data/README.MD) - I think of the data area as a pipeline from ingestion to storage, processing, analysis but I also put things lite edge computing, data quality, data governance and data privacy/security into this area. I have done some basic research in +10 new databases that would be interesting for most if they want to keep up with niche databases.

[Infrastructure](research/infrastructure/readme.md) - very basic overview of large cloud alternative like AWS, MS, Google - and niche players like Vercel and Netlify and others

[Algorithms](research/algorithms/algorithms.md) - not a lot but I needed a way to check the performance of algorithms. Most work on Algorithms and data structures I have done (during my reboot) in AlgoExpert.

[IoT](research/iot/readme.md) - I have experience from IoT from telecom but most recently the DeLaval platform where we used AWS IoT/Greengrass, and Yocto to build our edge platform". This directory is only a little follow on alternatives. During DeLaval we were also in discussions with Google about IoT.

[DevOps] - very basic things but again the work we did on DeLaval on DevOps and SRE and the toolchain required for all the steps in the DevOps model was quite extensive.

[Tools](research/tools/README.md) - I've use tools like VSC, GitHub/Git, and WSL/Ubuntu for my own work, then for each programming language you have a range of tools - but I haven't documented it.

[Systems Design](research/systems-design/s-README.md) - My expertise in systems architecture stems from working on telecom systems with complex models and large-scale RFQ processes at companies like Ericsson and Huawei. I enhanced this knowledge through AlgoExpert's systems design course, adding exercises from various sectors like social media, streaming, team collaboration, finance, real estate, and education.

[Blockchain](research/blockchain/README.md) - some very basic research, most research was done in Blockchain course

[Language](research/language/readme.md) - Go "weaknesses", Bun, and some javascript "end-to-end" around fetching, parsing & compilation, JIT compilation, execution content, DOM/CSSOM, event loop and physical execution, quality/test management, behavior driven development, big-o-notation, language trends, reactivity in "vanilla" javascript - you have to dig in the markdown files and the directories

[Math](research/math/readme.md) - a couple of math tools evaluated

## Infrastructure increasingly important (research/infrastructure)

With a 15-year history on AWS, I've played a key role in cloud infrastructure, including introducing Azure at Tele2 and migrating Hemnet to AWS. My experience also covers SRE, DevOps, and cost optimization. I've explored modern web development tools like Next.js through Vercel. I use this directory to research topics that I am curious about.
