
Hey there,

If you've stumbled upon this page in search of fresh courses and research, you're in the right spot.

Just so you know, the bulk of my code lives in private repos, but I do sprinkle a bit of my work here and in a side "play" repo.

# Short background

Most of the time the last 6 years i have lead digital team, at Telenor, Hemnet, Delaval, Codeta, done strategy stuff at NetOnNet and SJ and a startup during 2023 that I cannot talk about yet. Not a lot of hands coding, but at least I've kept up.

# I had to do a reboot

I've been brushing up on my skills with AlgoExpert throughout 2023â€”think LeetCode but broader. If you're curious, check out [AlgoExpert](http://www.algoexpert.io) for a treasure trove of videos and exercises covering everything from algorithms to machine learning.

It is +100 of hours of videomaterial and 100s of exercises in the following courses - algorithms, systems design, programming, front-end, blockchain and machine learning. It is quite massive, most likely spend a full 3 months on all of it.

# Toolbox and Skills

I nowaday use with VSC/vim motions, bash/zsh, git, and WSL/Ubuntu - and mix of Copilot, ChatGPT Plus, and perplexity. For project flows, Notion's my go-to, with Markdown/Git for the nitty-gritty. Great because I move freely between Mac, Windows and Linux.

## Web Front-end Fun

I keep tabs on the ever-expanding HTML landscape and the latest in CSS, including the buzz about the View Transition API. I've toyed with everything from custom CMS back in the day to Episerver and WordPress quite recently with clients. Led some microfrontend teams, delved into TypeScript, and got my hands dirty with React, Svelte, Vue, Solid and so on. I play around with HTMX and Tailwind/Daisy CSS for kicks, and Go has been my backend buddy.

## Natively speaking

Natively I have led teams using Kotlin (moving from Java) and Swift, I have looked at Flutter, Electron and Tauri, React-Native. I have old school experinece of Ajax, Applets, designing with tables, VBScript and CGI-scripting using Delphi and even J++ and COM+.

## Backend and Beyond

I have been into Go, Python, and TypeScript with my recent course binge. Got a soft spot for Ruby on Rails, and Rust is growing on me. My old-school love for Delphi and Java gets a nod too, especially with Java's recent facelift in version 21. I keep an eye on Zig and Mojo.

## Data

Thinking data-first, I've built up from data warehousing to leading AI/ML teams. Metadata (yaml), OpenAI's API, and Python for data transformation are my current focus areas.

## Architecture and Design

As for architecture, it's all about the big picture and connecting the dots from front to back, data to design. You'll find a few of the system designs in the systems design folders.

## Emerging technology

Blockchain's got my attention, and IoT's been a big playfield, especially with custom hardware. AWS has been my cloud home for 15 years, and I've seen Azure and Google Cloud from the inside.

## Design

I can manage Figma, and well acquainted with Storybook and building design systems/components (in Vue and React). I have worked in collaboration with in-house design teams, design agencies, branding agencies and at Delaval I led the teams behind the design system/design components.

I have picked up accessibility and have had an interest in Reactive programming since 2014 (spreadsheets are also reactive but perhaps doesn't count). In 2014 I used Meteor and have documented blitz talks about it :-). Founder of Vue worked with Meteor.

Cheers!

## Back-end

I have done a course on system design at Algoexpert and design is more specific around scope, how the system will be used, making a concept, looking at similar designs and major differencies, figuring out major user journeys, the main services and API's, the information model, sequence diagrams and system models. Then there are aspects like special algorithms needed, security perspectives, protocols used, costs and teams needed.

## Emerging technologies

I have done a course on Blockchain at AlgoExpert and have lead a large IoT initiative at Delaval using the AWS IoT/Greengrass stack - but we also build our own embedded hardware and our own Linux distribution.

## Infrastructure

my account at AWS is 15 years old, I helped introduce Azure at Tele2, migrated Hemnet to AWS (and we were presenting at AWS Summit) and we did a similar journey with AWS at Delaval - and I have some experience from Google cloud at Codeta (we migrated the front-end from Rackspace to Google cloud). I also have extensive experience in SRE and DevOps from these assignments and cost optimization experience.

## Product Management and UX

I see Product Management and UX as part of working with software. The responsibilies are always there and in larger setting roles and departments for these skills - and i have worked with 30 teams where UX and product are different departments to being a product/ux designer in a team and working interactively with a front-end/back-end team.
