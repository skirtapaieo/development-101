Welcome!

You might be lost - if not then here you can find have recent courses and research here.

I spend 2% of my coding here perhaps and 98% in private repositories (and 1% in my play repo).

# Courses

Main courses at Algoexpert (similar to leetcode) during 2023:

3. Programming (programmingExpert
4. Front-end (FrontendExpert)
5. Blockchain (BlockchainExpert)
6. Machine Learning (MachineLearningExpert)

# Research

Most of the things below are 6-9 months old (2023) as I have been on hiatus for a while from coding. I am incredibly enthusistic about the topics I mention below.

## Tools

I use vsc, and bash/zsh, git, wsl/ubuntu, trying out vsc neovim extension I use cop-pilot, chatgpt plus, bard frequently on desktop and sometimes bing and perplexity on mobile. I use notion for projects and markdown/git for minor things, figma, miro, excalidraw. And daily dose of twitter and youtube. I have tested codium, phind, coderabbit, cursor, codesandbox - and more - but nothing stuck :-)

## Front-end

I know that there are over 140 HTML tags nowadays, I follow CSS and am looking a View Transition API as a big change. I have a long-running interest in CMS, made a few myself (oldschool) with front-end and back-end tools - I have had to work with Episerver, Wordpress in professional clients, and with proprietary headless CMS as well. I have experience of leading microfrontend teams.

On JavaScript, I use Typescript (transpiler) and Zod for validations, done to two courses in React (library), interest in where RSC will end up. Tested Svelte (compiler) and curious about Runes and SolidJS (signals) and try follow Ryan Carniato on Youtube. I am acquainted with Angular (framework) but haven't worked with it. I Like the idea of VanJS and lead teams working on Vue (Delaval) and Ruby/Rails (Hemnet). When I do hobbyprojects I currently try use HTMX, Tailwind/Daisy CSS and Go/TypeScript. When using Python I use Pydantic to get some "type safety".

Also worked a little bit in Sketch and Figma to design things, well acquainted with Storybook and building design systems/components (in Vue and React). I have worked in collaboration with in-house design teams, design agencies, branding agencies and at Delaval I led a design system/design components initiative.

Natively I have led teams using Kotlin (moving from Java) and Swift, I have looked at Flutter, Electron and Tauri, React-Native. I have old school experinece of Ajac, Applet, designing with tables, VBScript and CGI-scripting using Delphi and also J++. I have used all Anders Heijlsbergs languages :)

I have picked up accessibility and have had an interest in Reactive programming since 2014 (spreadsheets are also reactive but perhaps doesn't count). In 2014 I used Meteor and have documented blitz talks about it :-). Founder of Vue worked with Meteor.

## Back-end

In the courses on top I have used Go, Python, React, JavaScript and TypeScript but I am new to Primeagen so I also like Rust more than I should :-) I am a big fan or Ruby and Rails started with leading teams at Hemnet that is one of the few large sites using that in Sweden. Sandy Metz books was our bible on how to think about Ruby. I like DHH. I have looked at Mojo for future use in AI/ML projects. I have written a little C and C++ and I am looking at Zig to expand my views.

My background is using Delphi (Anders Hejslberg language - and little J2EE and COM+ on the MS-side - that actually still is around) and Java (which in version 21 looks really good). So most modern back-end approaches including all improvements to C++ is really really nice DX for me :-).

## Data

I try to have a data mindset and think of the data area as a pipeline from data ingestions, to storage, processing, transforamtion, analysis, ML & AI and visualization. I have been involved in Data Warehouse development a telco scale, lead AI/ML team at Hemnet and at Delaval 90% of what we did was collecting data from farms and building services around the data and we also built Data Lake for future use. Currently I am focusing on using metadata (yaml), using LLMs (mainly OpenAI API), Clip (Dall:e), but also transforming data using Python and storing metadata, ORMs like Drizzle for avoiding. I have done a lot of OLTP SQL but it was a long time ago. There are so many new things like databases with versioning, vector databases and so on.

## Architecture and system design

in larger context architecture skills (modelling +100 subsystems in telco for example) helps you define front-end, back-end, data pipelines, infrastructure to give you a start.

I have done a course on system design at Algoexpert and design is more specific around scope, how the system will be used, making a concept, looking at similar designs and major differencies, figuring out major user journeys, the main services and API's, the information model, sequence diagrams and system models. Then there are aspects like special algorithms needed, security perspectives, protocols used, costs and teams needed.

## Emerging technologies

I have done a course on Blockchain at AlgoExpert and have lead a large IoT initiative at Delaval using the AWS IoT/Greengrass stack - but we also build our own embedded hardware and our own Linux distribution.

## Infrastructure

my account at AWS is 15 years old, I helped introduce Azure at Tele2, migrated Hemnet to AWS (and we were presenting at AWS Summit) and we did a similar journey with AWS at Delaval - and I have some experience from Google cloud at Codeta (we migrated the front-end from Rackspace to Google cloud). I also have extensive experience in SRE and DevOps from these assignments and cost optimization experience.

## Product Management and UX

I see Product Management and UX as part of working with software. The responsibilies are always there and in larger setting roles and departments for these skills - and i have worked with 30 teams where UX and product are different departments to being a product/ux designer in a team and working interactively with a front-end/back-end team.
