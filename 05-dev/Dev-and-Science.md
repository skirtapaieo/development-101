# The foundations of Development

## The stack of science

It is possible to think of layers of different scientific disciplines:

Some scientists and philosophers have proposed ways to think about the sciences as being "layered" based on the complexity of systems they study and their reliance on laws from more "fundamental" sciences.

| Layer | Scientific Discipline                | Description                                                            |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Mathematics                          | Provides the language and tools for all other sciences.                |
| 2     | Physics                              | Studies fundamental particles and forces.                              |
| 3     | Astronomy                            | Studies celestial objects, space, and the physical universe.           |
| 4     | Chemistry                            | Focuses on chemical reactions and the behavior of molecules.           |
| 5     | Biology                              | Investigates life, from single cells to complex organisms.             |
| 6     | Earth & Environmental Sciences       | Studies the Earth, its composition, and its interacting systems.       |
| 7     | Psychology                           | Examines individual behavior and mental processes.                     |
| 8     | Computer Science                     | Studies algorithms, computation, and information systems.              |
| 9     | Social Sciences                      | Investigates human societies and relationships, including economics.   |
| 10    | Applied Sciences (e.g., Engineering) | Uses principles from all previous layers to solve real-world problems. |
