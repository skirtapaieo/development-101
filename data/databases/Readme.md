# overview

(see readme.me in root as well)

Certainly, I can list each database option on its own line in the data pipeline table:

# additional data storage paradigms

Certainly! Let's integrate these technologies into the table. I'll place them in the appropriate categories based on their primary storage paradigms or functionalities:

| **Storage Paradigm**                     | **Description**                                                                                                                                  | **Popular Technologies**                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Columnar Databases**                   | Store data as columns rather than rows. Efficient for read-heavy operations on large datasets.                                                   | - Snowflake<br>- Google Cloud Bigtable<br>- Apache HBase<br>- Apache Cassandra                                     |
| **Distributed File System**              | Systems that manage files distributed across multiple machines. These can be the backbone for other systems like big data processing frameworks. | - Hadoop HDFS (Java)                                                                                               |
| **Time-Series Databases**                | Optimized for handling time-series data, such as metrics, telemetry, financial data, etc.                                                        | - InfluxDB<br>- TimescaleDB<br>- OpenTSDB<br>- Prometheus                                                          |
| **Graph Databases**                      | Store data as nodes and relationships. Ideal for querying complex interrelated data.                                                             | - Neo4j<br>- OrientDB<br>- ArangoDB                                                                                |
| **Document Databases**                   | Store data as documents (typically JSON, BSON). Provides flexibility in data schema.                                                             | - MongoDB<br>- CouchDB<br>- Elasticsearch<br>- Cloud Firestore<br>- Firebase Realtime Database                     |
| **Relational Databases**                 | Based on the relational model, where data is structured in tables with rows and columns. SQL is typically used for querying.                     | - PostgreSQL (SQL)<br>- SQLite (SQL)                                                                               |
| **Key-Value Stores**                     | Simple database that stores data as a set of key-value pairs. Highly scalable and often used for caching.                                        | - Redis<br>- Amazon DynamoDB<br>- Riak<br>- AWS DynamoDB                                                           |
| **Multi-Model Databases**                | Databases that support multiple data models (e.g., key-value, document, graph, columnar) within a single backend.                                | - Azure Cosmos DB                                                                                                  |
| **Vector Databases**                     | Designed to handle high-dimensional vector data. Useful in similarity search scenarios, especially in ML applications.                           | - Faiss (by Facebook AI)<br>- Annoy (by Spotify)<br>- Milvus                                                       |
| **BLOB Stores**                          | Designed for storing binary large objects (BLOBs) like images, audio, or video.                                                                  | - Amazon S3<br>- Azure Blob Storage<br>- Google Cloud Storage                                                      |
| **Spatial Databases**                    | Store and query data based on its spatial characteristics (e.g., location data).                                                                 | - PostGIS (extension for PostgreSQL)<br>- MySQL Spatial Extensions                                                 |
| **Quadtree (and other spatial indices)** | Hierarchical data structure used to represent spatial data (like 2D space) to optimize range queries.                                            | Typically a feature in spatial databases, GIS systems, and graphics software, rather than standalone technologies. |

I've added Snowflake, Hadoop HDFS, Firebase Realtime Database, Cloud Firestore, PostgreSQL, SQLite, AWS DynamoDB, Azure Cosmos DB, and Google Cloud Bigtable into the table. Note that some of these (like Snowflake) offer broader functionality than a simple columnar store, but for the sake of simplicity, they are categorized by their primary or most recognizable functionality in this table.
