Hi, we have an algorithmic problem see after // Problem //. Please apply the guidelines that you find in // Guidelines //. To make sure the solution we suggest is right look at an example of a correct solution in // Correct solution //. Don't forget to add test cases and typedoc commenting.

// Problem //

You're given an array of integers prices of length n with the retail prices of various quantities of juice. Each index in this array corresponds to the price of that amount of juice. For example, prices[2] would be the retail price of 2 units of juice.

You have n - 1 total units of juice. For example, if the length of prices is 5, then you would have 4 total units of juice. Write a function to determine the optimal way to bottle the juice such that it maximizes revenue. This function should return a list of all of the juice quantities required in ascending order.

Note that the first value in the prices array will always be 0, because there is no value in no juice. All other values will be positive integers. Additionally, a larger quantity of juice will not always be more expensive than a smaller quantity. For simplicity, all of the test cases only have one possible solution.

Sample Input
prices = [0, 1, 3, 2]
Sample Output
[1, 2] // We have 3 total units of juice,
// because the length of prices is 4.
// To maximize revenue, we split the juice into
// quantities of 1 and 2, giving a revenue of 1 + 3 = 4

// Guidelines //

Please use the following template and replace <..> with the proper text for the section.

See the commenting example below for a Depth First Search example on how to do it. Use typescript and make a function.

Generate the code neeed and the variants needed, and the necessary tests please.

/**
 * Name:        Depth First Search
 *
 * Problem:    Traverse a graph by going as deep as possible, if possible, before backtracking
 *
 * Details:     You a given a Node class that has a name and an array of optional children nodes.
 *              When put together, nodes form an acyclic tree-like structure.
 *              Implement the depthFirstSearch method on the Node class.
 *              It takes in and empty array.
 *
 * Variations:  Size of input, structure of graph, available memory, available time
 *
 * Solutions:   Recursive approach: O(v + h) time | O(v) space,
 *                  size of input: smaller lists, more readable
 *                  structure of graph: for trees, not for graphs with cycles
 *              Iterative approach: O(v + e) time | O(v) space,
 *                  size of input: for larger lists, more performant
 *                  structure of graph: for tree and graphs with cycles
 *              Generator function approach: O(v + e) time | O(v) space,
 *                  size of input: for larger lists, more performant
 *                  structure of graph: for trees
 *              Custom data structure approach: O(v + e) time | O(v) space,
 *                  size of input: for even larger lists, more performant
 *                  structure of graph: for tree and graphs with cycles
 *
 * Language:    TypeScript/JavaScript
 *
 * Performance: Partly mentioned in solutions
 *
 * Dependencies: None (except for TypeScript/JavaScript)
 *
 * Validation:  Zod: https://github.com/colinhacks/zod#introduction (not used)
 *
 * Edge cases:  Empty input, invalid input, null values, cycles, disconnected components
 *
 * Test cases:  Yes (7) Basic_Tree_Structure, Single_Child_At_Each_Node, Nested_Children, Large_Tree,
 *              Empty_Graph, Disconnected_Components, Invalid_Input_Test, Null_Value_Test, Single_Node
 *
 * Input ex:    graph = A
                    /  |  \
                    B   C   D
                / \     / \
                E   F   G   H
                    / \   \
                    I   J   K
 *
 * Output ex:   ["A", "B", "E", "F", "I", "J", "C", "D", "G", "K", "H"]

// Correct Solution >>

Example of a correct solution:

export function juiceBottling(prices: number[]) {
  const numSizes = prices.length;
  const maxProfit = new Array(numSizes).fill(0);
  const dividingPoints = new Array(numSizes).fill(0);

  for (let size = 0; size < numSizes; size++) {
    for (let dividingPoint = 0; dividingPoint < size + 1; dividingPoint++) {
      const possibleProfit = maxProfit[size - dividingPoint] + prices[dividingPoint];

      if (possibleProfit > maxProfit[size]) {
        maxProfit[size] = possibleProfit;
        dividingPoints[size] = dividingPoint;
      }
    }
  }

  const solution: number[] = [];
  let currentDividingPoint = numSizes - 1;
  while (currentDividingPoint > 0) {
    solution.push(dividingPoints[currentDividingPoint]);
    currentDividingPoint -= dividingPoints[currentDividingPoint];
  }

  return solution;
}
