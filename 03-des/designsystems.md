## Design systems

A design system is a collection of standards for design and front end code. It serves as a guide to help teams design and build digital products more efficiently and consistently. Here are some elements that a design system typically consists of:

- Style Guide: This includes the brand's color palette, typography, grid systems, spacing, and more. It sets the visual language of the brand.
- UI Components / Patterns Library: This is a library of reusable interface elements like buttons, form fields, modals, navigation menus, and more. They are built according to the style guide and often includes variations to suit different situations.
- Usage Guidelines: For each component and pattern, there should be clear instructions on when and how to use them. This can include do's and don'ts, design principles, and more.
- Iconography and Imagery: Icons and images used in the products. These need to be consistent with the style guide and contribute to the overall user experience.
- Voice and Tone Guidelines: This covers how the brand communicates with users through text. It can include copywriting guidelines, grammar and punctuation rules, and examples.
- Code Snippets: These are pre-written pieces of code that developers can reuse. They ensure that the code for each component remains consistent across the products.
- Documentation: Thorough documentation that details how to use the design system, how to contribute to it, and how it's organized. This is an important resource for both designers and developers.
- Design Tools and Resources: These can include downloadable design files, templates, or even design tool plugins that make it easy for designers to use the design system.

The general approach:

- The foundation is part strategy and part design.
- brand guidelines - story, logo usage, color palette, typography, imagery, voice and tone, print and digital
- Use a good range of tools ..
- details - spacing, layout, buttom styles, form styles

## Create the Design components

Using Figma for example, you can create a wide array of components, for each principle, like styles, colors and other elements.

- Clarify requirements and scope
- Create a style guid
- Build (design) components
- Prepare a Figma library
- Use version control (Github)

### Create UI components

Using Storybook for example, can help you address to challenges with components, stories, browsers, viewports and additional requirements related to, for example, accessibility

- Build components in Storybook
- Create stories in storybook
- Docucment the components
- Create a CI/CD pipeline
