# Automated, continuous screenshots

Automated screenshot capturing can be an essential part of your release or testing process. It allows you to visualize how your website appears across different devices and browsers. Some methods:

### Puppeteer (Node.js)

Puppeteer can be used for headless browsing and can capture screenshots.

```javascript
const puppeteer = require("puppeteer");

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  await page.goto("https://example.com");
  await page.screenshot({ path: "screenshot.png" });

  await browser.close();
})();
```

### Sauce Labs / BrowserStack

Cloud-based services that provide automated testing on different devices and browsers. They also offer APIs for taking screenshots.

### Cypress

Cypress is another end-to-end testing framework that allows for easy screenshot capturing.

```javascript
// Visit page and take a full-page screenshot
cy.visit("https://example.com");
cy.screenshot();
```
