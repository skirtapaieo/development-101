# Design and UX

It is central to understand the intersection of UX, design and technology

## Currently doing

- Performance benchmark of leading sites in industry (for client)

  - SEO and Accessibility secondary
  - Programmatically automated lighthouse, webpagetests, pagespeed
  - Unlighthouse to review the full site/all pages
  - Manual testing of size and rendering
  - Final report (in ppt)

- Experimenting with UX design and AI for startup
  - Bard to create HTML/CSS from screenshot of a particular design
  - Uizard tests to create a copy of a particular design
  - Canva and ChatGPT

## What about AI and design?

- ChatGPT - ex for personas, competitor analysis
- MidJourney - moodboards, icons, content, and other assets
- Adobe Creative - added AI to some of the tools
- UIzard - scans design sketches and transforms them to digital designs
- Bard - interpret screenshot and create code (html/css)

## Recently

- Led program:
  - Built a design system using Figma, Storybook and component libraries (React/Vue)
  - User session tracking (HotJar)
  - Front-end security (Detectify)
  - Analytics (Google Analytics, Tag Management)
  - User performance and error tracking (Sentry)
  - Security reviews (Detectify)

## Further back

- Balances 100s of cross-functional teams - with product, ux, developers and other expertise
- Participated in branding-centrix startups with branding and design agencies
- Led technical parts of design systems and have a very good understanding of various approaches
- I can participate hands-on if necessary (Figma (sketch), Adobe Creative Suite)
- Usability testing (both qualitative and quantitative)

## About approaches

**Startups** often need to move quickly and have less structured processes, which is why low-cost and flexible methods like sketching, wireframing, and digital prototyping tend to be highly applicable. Startups may also benefit from Lean UX, which focuses on learning and iterating quickly. Design systems may be less applicable in early stages because they require a significant investment to set up and are most beneficial when design consistency is needed across a large number of pages or components, which may not yet be the case for startups.

**Scaleups** are in a stage where they're growing rapidly but also trying to formalize processes to maintain consistency and efficiency. They can benefit from all the approaches, but design systems become particularly important to maintain design consistency as the product and team grow.

**Enterprises** have more established processes and larger teams, which can make it beneficial to have formal design systems in place. They often have the resources to invest in thorough user-centered design practices and can afford the time to create high-fidelity prototypes. Simpler methods like sketching and designing in your head may be less applicable due to the need for clear communication and documentation in larger teams.
