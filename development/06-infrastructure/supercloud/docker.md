This Dockerfile does the following:

- It starts from the official Node.js 14 image. This includes Node.js and npm, so you don't need to install them manually.

- It sets the working directory to /app. This is the directory inside the container in which all the commands will run.

- It copies the package.json and package-lock.json files into the container. These files define your application's dependencies.

- It runs npm install to install your application's dependencies. This is done before copying the rest of your code to take advantage of Docker's layer caching and reduce build times when your dependencies don't change.

- It copies the rest of your code into the container.

- It exposes port 3000, which is the port your application listens on.

- Finally, it defines the command to run your application. In this case, it's node app.js.

To build a Docker image from this Dockerfile, you can use the docker build command, specifying a name for your image (like hello-world) and the location of the Dockerfile (the current directory, specified as .):
