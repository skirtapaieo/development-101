## Why NPM was created?

NPM was created to provide a package management system for Node.js. The primary aim was to enable developers to easily manage project dependencies and distribute JavaScript software.

## Who created NPM

NPM was created by Isaac Z. Schlueter. It was initially released in January 2010 as an open-source project.

## How and When NPM was started

NPM was started in 2010 as a companion to Node.js to handle packages and modules. Over the years, it has grown to become the default package manager for the Node.js runtime environment, serving millions of packages to the community.

## Who uses NPM?

NPM is used by JavaScript and TypeScript developers to manage packages that contain project dependencies. This includes front-end developers, back-end developers, and full-stack developers who work on various types of JavaScript projects.

## Overview of the NPM stack

- **Node.js**: NPM is a Node.js package manager, so Node.js is a prerequisite.
- **JSON**: Package configuration is usually handled through a `package.json` file.
- **NPM CLI**: The command-line interface is the primary tool for interacting with NPM.
- **NPM Registry**: The online repository where packages are published and stored.
- **Server-side / Client-side JS**: NPM can manage packages for both server-side (Node.js) and client-side (browser) JavaScript code.

Note that while NPM was originally designed for Node.js, it is commonly used in modern front-end JavaScript stacks as well.
