# Data types

| Data Type            | Description                                                                | Examples                                    | Technologies & Tools                                 |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Structured Data      | Organized data that conforms to a schema. Common in relational databases.  | Rows/columns in a DB, CSV files             | RDBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server)             |
| Semi-Structured Data | Doesn't reside in relational DBs but has some organizational properties.   | XML, JSON, YAML                             | NoSQL databases (MongoDB, CouchDB), Document storage |
| Unstructured Data    | Data without a pre-defined model or organization.                          | Text documents, logs, emails                | ElasticSearch, Blob storage, Object storage (AWS S3) |
| Binary Data (BLOB)   | Binary data stored as a single entity.                                     | Images, audio files                         | BLOB storage in RDBMS, AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage    |
| Time-Series Data     | Data that's time-stamped and collected at successive points in time.       | Stock market data, sensor data              | Time-series DBs (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB)              |
| Graph Data           | Data using graph structures (nodes, edges, properties) for representation. | Social networks, organizational hierarchies | Graph DBs (Neo4j, ArangoDB)                          |
| Streaming Data       | Continuously generated data from sources.                                  | IoT sensor data, user clickstreams          | Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, Apache Spark Streaming   |
| Image Data           | Visual data captured as a digital representation.                          | Digital photos, X-rays                      | Object storage (AWS S3), TensorFlow, PyTorch         |
| Sound Data           | Auditory data captured as waveforms or digital representation.             | Music files, voice recordings               | Object storage, Fourier transforms, LibROSA          |
| Video Data           | Combination of visual and auditory data captured over time.                | Movies, CCTV footage                        | Object storage, Media storage services, OpenCV       |
| Text Data            | Sequential characters representing linguistic content.                     | Books, articles, logs                       | ElasticSearch, NLP tools (NLTK, SpaCy)               |
