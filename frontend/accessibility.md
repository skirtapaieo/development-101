# Accessibility 

Using the above example, in the context of accessibility: 

Looking at the given code, it does follow some general accessibility practices but could be improved in other areas:

- **Use of alt attribute**: The image has an alt attribute which is very good. This attribute provides alternative text for those who can't see images. However, the value "An example image" is not very descriptive. It should ideally contain a brief description of the image.

- **Semantics**: The code doesn't use semantic HTML elements. Semantic elements like ```<header>', <footer>, <section>, <article>, and <nav> ``` make it easier for both people and machines (like search engines and screen readers) to understand the content structure. Consider replacing ```<div>``` tags with semantic HTML where appropriate.

- **Font size**: The code specifies font sizes in pixels which is not ideal for accessibility. Instead, relative units like em or rem should be used to make the site more flexible for users who need or prefer larger text.

- **Color contrast**: The code doesn't specify color, which means that it will default to browser settings. In practice, it's important to ensure that text and background colors have sufficient contrast for readability, especially for users with visual impairments.

- **Keyboard Navigation**: There is no specific code here for keyboard navigation (like specifying tabindex). Keyboard navigation is critical for users who can't use a mouse.

## Accessibility from design perspective

Figma, a popular collaborative interface design tool, supports a variety of plugins to help designers create more accessible designs. Here's a brief overview of the ones you mentioned:

1. **A11y - Annotation Kit**: This Figma plugin helps designers communicate accessibility specifications to developers by allowing them to annotate their designs with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.1 requirements. The plugin comes with a set of components that can be added to the designs to indicate things like color contrast, keyboard focus, and other important accessibility elements.

2. **Twitter's Accessibility Annotation Library**: Created by Twitter's design team, this Figma library helps designers add accessibility annotations directly into their design files. These annotations can guide developers to create products that are inclusive and accessible to everyone.

3. **Axe - Axe for Designers**: Developed by Deque Systems, Axe for Designers is a plugin for Figma that checks your designs for accessibility issues while you're still in the design phase. It can detect issues related to color contrast, missing text alternatives, incorrect hierarchy, and much more, helping to catch and resolve accessibility problems before they make it into the development stage.

These tools are extremely valuable in creating more inclusive designs and should be an integral part of the design process for any team committed to accessibility. Remember, it's easier (and less expensive) to address accessibility issues during the design phase than after development has been completed.

Please note, while these tools can help identify many potential accessibility issues, they are not exhaustive, and manual checks and user testing should also be included in the design and development process.

## Accessibility requirements

Here are some key accessibility requirements and how they can be implemented:

1. **Proper use of HTML Semantics**: Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages rather than merely to define its presentation or look. This helps screen readers determine what is a header, what is a paragraph, which elements form a list, etc.

    ```html
    <header>
      <h1>Website Title</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <h2>Content Heading</h2>
      <p>Some text.</p>
    </main>
    <footer>
      <p>Website Footer</p>
    </footer>
    ```
2. **Alt Text for Images**: All `img` elements must have an `alt` attribute. The alt text describes the image to users who are unable to see it.

    ```html
    <img src="path-to-image.jpg" alt="Describe the image">
    ```

3. **Ensure sufficient color contrast**: A contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text is recommended. 

    CSS for this requirement will vary depending on the specific color scheme of your website. However, here's an example of sufficient contrast:

    ```css
    body {
        background-color: #ffffff; /* white background */
        color: #333333; /* dark grey text */
    }
    ```
4. **Label form elements properly**: Every input field should have a `label` associated with it. This can be achieved using the `for` attribute of the `label` element.

    ```html
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
    ```

5. **Keyboard Navigation**: The website should be fully navigable using the keyboard alone. This is automatically handled by HTML when using semantic elements, but you need to ensure custom interactive components are accessible too.

    If creating a custom interactive element, you might need to use `tabindex`:

    ```html
    <div tabindex="0">Custom interactive element</div>
    ```

6. **Aria roles and properties**: ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and properties can provide additional information about elements and their state. For example, if you have a button that opens a dropdown menu, you could use `aria-haspopup` and `aria-expanded`:

    ```html
    <button aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">Open Menu</button>
    ```

7. **Avoid fixed font sizes**: Allow the user to zoom in or out on a webpage. Use relative units like `em` or `rem` rather than pixels.

    ```css
    body {
        font-size: 2em;
    }
    ```

8. **Provide captions and transcripts for audio and video content**: This is necessary for users who are deaf or hard of hearing.

    ```html
    <video controls>
        <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        <track kind="captions" src="captions.vtt" srclang="en">
    </video>
    ```

These are only some of the requirements for accessibility. Always refer to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure you're meeting all necessary standards. It's also good practice to use accessibility audit tools and conduct user testing with a diverse group of users.

## WCAG 

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) cover a far broader range of areas than the eight above. 

The guidelines are divided into three levels: 
- A (minimum),
- AA (mid range), and
- AAA (highest).

WCAG 2.1 consists of 78 success criteria.

The eight areas mentioned are some of the more commonly discussed aspects of accessibility, but the full guidelines cover many more areas. Here are just a few additional examples:

9. **Use of color**: WCAG states that color should not be used as the sole method of conveying content or distinguishing visual elements. For example, errors in a form should not only be indicated by changing the color of the input field.

10. **Page titles**: Each page should have a title that describes its purpose or content to help users navigate and find content.

11. **Language identification**: The primary language of a page should be identified in the HTML code to help screen readers use correct pronunciation.

12. **Focus order**: When navigating by keyboard, the focus order should be logical and intuitive to help users understand and navigate content.

13. **On input**: Changing the setting of any user interface component should not automatically cause a change of context, unless the user has been advised of this behavior before using the component.

14. **Consistent navigation and identification**: Navigation mechanisms and components that have the same functionality within a set of web pages are identified consistently to avoid confusion for users.

15. **Error identification and suggestions**: If an input error is automatically detected, the item that is in error should be identified and the error should be described to the user in text. Also, if possible, provide suggestions for correction.

16. **Timeouts**: Users should be warned of the duration of any user inactivity that could cause data loss, unless the data is preserved for more than 20 hours of user inactivity.

17. **Non-text contrast**: The visual presentation of User Interface components, graphical objects and states must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colors.

These are just some additional examples. For a comprehensive list, you can refer to the WCAG guidelines on the W3C website. The guidelines are very thorough and aim to provide a web experience that is accessible to as wide a range of users as possible.
